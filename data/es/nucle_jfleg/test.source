>>es<< while the travel company will most likely show them some interesting sites in order for their customers to advertise for their company to their family and friends , it is highly unlikely , that the company will tell about the sites that were not included in the tour -- for example due to entrance fees that would make the total package price overly expensive .
>>es<< disadvantage is parking their car is very difficult .
>>es<< bigger farming are use more chemical product and substance to feed fish .
>>es<< Forexample , My cousin is 12years old .
>>es<< if it does , you will only get some misundrestood idea about that acticle but not the original one .
>>es<< secondly , chimp can also present the capability for grammer which means it can demonstrate the ability to combine words and be able to use grammatical constructions .
>>es<< nevertheless , this city is having a big change .
>>es<< I think to learn facts is only an evidence if the students can work hard and if they are able to keep every detailled information as tought , but it &apos;s definitly not an evidence for their intelligence .
>>es<< Unforturntly , almost older people can not use internet , in spite of benefit of internet .
>>es<< so , if i have alot of information about this subject , i will taulk too much with knowledge but if i have general information for this subject , i will talk about this subjec with my limited knowlege and this case may be make me shame like when my brother asked me about some thing but i have not alot of information about this thing .
>>es<< becuse if i see some one did somthing to may safe me time and engy and it wok &apos;s i will do it .

>>es<< he said in other words that the more flouride may create damage in human body , specifically the bone .
>>es<< when these people create their new ideas others often look very strange on them .
>>es<< no ohter transportation concept has been as successful as the car , not only because the goog street and highway system throughout the United States and Europe , but only because off the fact , that people love their cars .
>>es<< if they prefer to choose cars than motor bike , that means there will be many cars .
>>es<< that &apos;s why he is a legend in these days and people repect him .
>>es<< for example , in math club , teachers usually teach us how to solve a math problem using vary ways .
>>es<< in order hand , when I was a fresh man in my college , I could concentrate on my favorit subjects .
>>es<< I have an IBM computer and my laptop is Dell .
>>es<< when price of gas goes up , the consumer do not want buy gas for fuels .
>>es<< although , learning more subjects gives us a huge knowledge which is make me sucssesfu in my study .
>>es<< when you`re making a tour guide trip , you already have a everything settled from the time you`re departing to the time you arrive .
>>es<< on the other hand , although in Turkey the public transportation is getting developed especially in the two big cities , that is , Ankara and Istanbul , it is still nothing compared to Sweden .
>>es<< as they are involved with study , they donot get enough time to look after their community .
>>es<< however , I strongly maintained that traveling by their own gives a lot of advantages .
>>es<< the even ask themself how this kind of things did n &apos;t cross their mind .
>>es<< people tends to choose other medias , and that is why litterature is in danger .
>>es<< I cast doubt that twenty years is too short time to prove the problem .
>>es<< so for these reasons i really believe that it &apos;s important to have a broad knowledge on different subjects , instead of being focused on just one , because sometime the answer that we are searching for , we can easily find it in a field that can seems not related to our purpose .
>>es<< I am pleased to know intelligent peple and learn about things which I do n &apos;t know .
>>es<< to resolve this problem , the governments of the cities are likely to improve the public transportation system by building new subway system and adding more lines for buses .
>>es<< I know lots of old people who go to parties , stay always in contact with others people .
>>es<< but these thing seem to hard for old people , they move so hardly , and do n &apos;t have health body to play this thing like sports .
>>es<< for example , if you understand the idea that all diseases , caused by microorganisms , are treated with the antibiotics , you will never use antidepressants .

>>es<< in her salary we cant buy some car because we are planing to finish our hause in Binangonan , Rizal and we will planing to finish my study in Boston .
>>es<< so the information technology and advanced technology are so much increased .
>>es<< even more relevant to the seduction of advertisement is the fact that quite frequently those images of perfection placed in front of our eyes are just mirages and illusions , bodies touched up by computer programs and therefore , they do not resemble reality at all .
>>es<< as the professor claimed the details and examples to strengthen the position of reading passage , which I , in the following pargarghs , would like to provide the evidence to present the whole views .
>>es<< in the advertisement that he shows in the media , newspapers , magazines , and public spaces , he clearly says that the product is made with products of high quality in technology .
>>es<< we have a lot of paper have to write .

>>es<< firstly the striped bass consume large quantitiy of menhaden , secondly this fish is also a source of protein for farm animal , and fishing industry gives work some people in Virginia .
>>es<< they were drove settlements in other domain .
>>es<< the time line about this danger , which i have already given in the above discussion is so predictable that one can have even calculations about it if he / she has both the population and existing fuel count .
>>es<< I think people should travel by making decision by themselves with sevral reasons .
>>es<< indeed , they threat lot of freshwater fish species because they need to eat and to find different kind of food in the oceans .
>>es<< for example , if the city says that 8am ~ 9 am is the most busiest time , than worker would argues that they drive a bit later
>>es<< educators should provide opportunities for them to learn enough knowledge to survive the real world .
>>es<< traditional enclopedias are written by trained expert for academic rigor that can not really achieve .
>>es<< by the time up everyone should be gathered up in a certain place .
>>es<< else twenty years down the lane every major city would end up being a pile of metal junkyard , with no place to move around .
>>es<< in contrast , the speaker casts doubt on the conclusion .
>>es<< in this movie father has handicapped .
>>es<< Fo example , in this genaration people watch movies and listen to musics more than read books and novels .
>>es<< in malysia , there are a lot of cars .
>>es<< so they are free to do all sorts of things , even if thez are cinsidered as dangerous or irrisponsble , such as bungee-jumping .
>>es<< I think most of the people will like that in a busy world , but I don`t thing it will happen the next twenty years .

>>es<< new kinds of vehicles will be invented with new technology than today .
>>es<< this would have definately required him to take out immense amount of time from his work and he stands as a perfect example with whom the youngsters of today relate .
>>es<< they follow the way the Sun goes from the east to the west .
>>es<< it &apos;s the time to take a rest looking back in your present .
>>es<< I thought it is kind of ridicurous , but we have to do as tour guide said .
>>es<< so , if Japan has such common sense since long time ago , even after twenty years for sure , people will aim to own a car and still ride a car to show people that they are ``rich &apos; &apos; .
>>es<< an example that would make this categorization problemmatic is an architect .
>>es<< and also the markting can do some adjust about the changing .

>>es<< confidence comes naturally since perfection is its along .
>>es<< reasons is pay for them and teach the more than other institute .
>>es<< nowadays , the society is changing drasticly .

>>es<< in the world oil price very high right now .
>>es<< the cause of the Tunguska explosion is asteroid .
>>es<< after we know and learn the facts , it will be easier for us to understand ideas and concepts .
>>es<< they did not get the ideas or any concepts about what they learn .
>>es<< and at the end , if you take a risk and you success in that , you surely will become a successful person with all the merits , and maybe also the awards , you merit .
>>es<< in my essy i want to focus on : how impotant is for students to learn facts .
>>es<< I naturally get to know that I do n &apos;t really want to know .
>>es<< however , what makes a student excellent is to both understand the concept and learn the facts .
>>es<< lrenikg the studens the ideas have many advantegis :
>>es<< do I want to risk my 2 years savings for a trip to Spain or do I want to use my kids college fund to start up my business ?
>>es<< so even the government is expecting the increase in the use of four Wheeler .
>>es<< and you can have chanse to make a your person to help you .
>>es<< he or she would not be able to discuss spesific problems just because he does not know them .

>>es<< actually it might not be true .
>>es<< we still have to burn down forest to make land for farming and the result is bird will lose more of their habitat .

>>es<< this is the goverment rule that they have compulsory attand this seminar .
>>es<< they might put it on the label , but they do n &apos;t say it on TV advertising .

>>es<< without the empirical experience , i think , the learner tend to forget all the information he or she have learned throuhout his or her learning process in a long term .

>>es<< they have to contact variety fields to find out what their interests are .
>>es<< unfortunately in the most of the countries the functioning of the public transport is not perfecty organised .
>>es<< if you think of the consumtions of them , fishes have less fat and a lot of nutrients there .
>>es<< the public transpotation in the city may not be able to cope with this huge amount of people flow .
>>es<< second , we learn many academic subjects , after that we learn specialize in one specific subject .
>>es<< this does n &apos;t mean that because you take risks you are going to succed .
>>es<< one of the most important problem is accidents for sure everyday millions of people dies jus because of the drivers not being carefull as a matter affect i do believe that there will be less cars in twenty years but this will happen just for one reasen that we will use somethink else .
>>es<< Internet offer a good opportunity for people that travel for work , for a student , for work .
>>es<< can you ever visualize what a chaos our society would suffer if every individual considers himself / herself an expert in every given field ?
>>es<< in this sense , I would introduce the concepts of two aspects with a datailed analysis , and then it will comes to the conclusion .
>>es<< in my case , my yonger brother need to more than academic knowledge .
>>es<< due to this , I feel that specialized students have more opportunity in future .
>>es<< moreover before the oil and gas gone scientist will make new car that go by electricity or by sun light .
>>es<< I larned many kind of subject , also I could make difrent types friends .
>>es<< on top of that , even we are willing to spend the time to draft the travel plan , we have no idea on which travel sites are must-see .
>>es<< they need to have a global vision before deciding what the like , and the way of obtaining it is simply studying a broad syllabus .

>>es<< and in the place where there is no train we can not help using cars .
>>es<< you have to teach your child since he or she was antel they graw up .
>>es<< if students have to study for history for example it is often enough to just learn the facts but on the other hand studing for physics or maths needs the understanding of the concepts .
>>es<< first , young people have a active mind .
>>es<< obviously the unreplaciable examination and less enemy can bring huge advance to fulfill the defination about success .
>>es<< young people nowdays do n &apos;t give enough time to helping their communities .
>>es<< the commercial was defenately more impressive than the product itself .
>>es<< and one of them was my friend who had seriouse prblems with her health .
>>es<< Ihad good life in my cauntry but everything I got from my patents .
>>es<< but if the student is going only learning things whithout knowing the concept then not any company is give apportunity to that person because he does not know the concept of its related branch so by this way its create a problem in the future .
>>es<< third , stone tower of east coast is making unnatural way also this tower is unusual in Europe so non Europian might be made this tower .

>>es<< however , the fact that they most of the time do not reflect the actual quality of a product decreases the reliability of the advertisements .
>>es<< we seem to have a lot of problem with those even if we have more good materials than in the past .
>>es<< we can be fatalist an say that with the developing of the third world , the problem will worsen .
>>es<< this things can make us more successful in life ; even though were that successful we must continue are work , we should take our chances to the greater heights .
>>es<< for the Greeks philosopher Plato an Aristotle , the capacity for understand ideas and concepts , the intelligence as the main ability of the human soul , is the part of ourselves that makes us the being we actually are .
>>es<< in conclusion understanding the concepts is the more important than learning the facts , because it &apos;s the ultimate gole of learning the facts .
>>es<< first , the ships not only helped them to spread but also they killed by ships .
>>es<< they might be bored of reading a complex passage .
>>es<< but it is possible to have a broad knowledge of many academis subjects without being specialized in one particular topic ?
>>es<< so she decides to work in a nursing Home because she wants to provide care for elderly people .
>>es<< this demonstrates the undeniable fact that it is bebeficial to having differnt experiences .

>>es<< in my case , I am working more than 200 hours a month , in order to get money required to pay back to a bank ( I borrowed some money for buying my house . ) .
>>es<< because , student must do homework .
>>es<< it &apos;s make a good partner .

>>es<< so i asked my student , how did he think about my lesson , and tried to find out where the proublem it is .
>>es<< that means if I have an broad knowledge in politics then I m aware that &apos;where to speak what &apos; .
>>es<< he also tells fact concepts to the students .
>>es<< after majoring in any feild of studies a student can not adjust immidiatly with the practical world .
>>es<< by contrast , the lecture claims that quality of discussion is the most important instead of the numbers of discussion .
>>es<< concepts of a subject gives us the background of main streams of a subject we are going to learn and study .
>>es<< this example proves that knowing the fact is less important compare to knowing the concepts related to it .
>>es<< Einstien &apos;s seminal theory of relativity is proved by facts .
>>es<< while i was there someone tried to steal my bag and passport .
>>es<< second the rouds can not be damged because raising the tax there will be much less cars .

>>es<< I dont have a car but i dreaming it off .
>>es<< because the rest of the period the way they work could be different .
>>es<< this will definitely cause some promblems .
>>es<< nowadays each of the family member owns a car .
>>es<< when you are able to understand ideas and concepts and with this are able to understand structures of thinking this can help you a lot .
>>es<< in America , alot of family have more than one cars , and futhermore some of them have three or four .
>>es<< thus i see more people opting for their own car in the near future .
>>es<< so people who they do not give enough time to helping their communities , they should repair this .
>>es<< otherwise , he / she may feel inadequate one day if he / she furthers his / her study .
>>es<< most of us will understand better when the ideas and the concepts of the war is shown and we can get vey exited with it .

>>es<< but factully Secondly , It need to experiance .
>>es<< therefore French revolution happend in the middle age in Eruope because of that reasons . &apos; &apos;

>>es<< annd we can save many time cthe the second , the tour guide will be interduce the spot of enqui culture , then we can enjoy the deedly trip , not only go over thereto stay a few time .
>>es<< understand how they work would give students a better lesson .
>>es<< Scond , Menzied points that Chinese ships in the 1400s used very distinctive anchors that were round stones with a hole in the middle .
>>es<< young people can work easily and can search any information in a few minutes .
>>es<< in a group trip , we are forced to the goup time schedules .
>>es<< probably , by using my own car this would have been much more difficult and stressful , if not impossible .
>>es<< help others and make we all live in a confortable home .
>>es<< there may be global warming because of lacking of cooling .
>>es<< so , their parents will buy for them .
>>es<< thy are busy in there self , thy dont spend time to help the society that they live in .
>>es<< and it seems like that notion will be even strengthen by the emergence of new Chinese producers how are even cheaper .
>>es<< I can remember that in alecture iattended .
>>es<< Ther third reason , is that give us the chance to make our brain work and think about how this happien .
>>es<< television makers just hung academic title on their program .
>>es<< even altough everthing when there is a life there is a hope .
>>es<< they have espessial diet .
>>es<< this is clearly seen in the way many young people organize the collection of funds or books to help others receive a proper education , and , also in the way many students go to schools for the blind to read out books to them and help them out .
>>es<< as a result , young people feels a less sense of competition for a place in universities .
>>es<< however , Billgate developed people &apos;s lives more comfortable than previos circumstance .
>>es<< also , students , by paying more attention to understanding ideas and concepts , will not only comprehend the facts they are given , but also acquire the skill of understanding , which can be applied in all areas surrounding them .
>>es<< if a person just know the facts , he would never think about the possibilities .
>>es<< though , in fact , old people can enjoy themselves some light sports entertainments , I think that not interesting than hard sports or something .
>>es<< they do not want to regret of their lives on earth .
>>es<< it is better to have a very good understanding knowledege of many academic because it makes you broad and gives you chances and oppurtunity to work in different fields and enviroment .
>>es<< for instance , Yang Zhenning , who is a famous scientist with great achievements and fame , has a high proficiency in literature while specifying the scientific research in physics .
>>es<< it is said that the zebra mussel from the bottom of the ship moved to the freshwather and devastate the nature .
>>es<< this implies that there can be instances were no such overstating take place at all .
>>es<< in my opinion there are some reasons why it is true .
>>es<< and availablity of jobs to the candidates having specfic knowledge is less when compare to the all round perormer ,
>>es<< Becuase when you understand the whole idea you can imagine how does the theory work .
>>es<< it is not worth to jump in pool without knowing how to swim since you may not be able to breath again .
>>es<< the person who takes many subjects stands az better chanceof getting a job .
>>es<< so to solve that kinds of problem they will have to use their understanding .
>>es<< another thing is that adverts always show and indicate prices on commdities alowing consumers to budget well in order to be able to buy them .
>>es<< however the successful person who achieved great accomplishment do not escape or give up easily in front of the even impossible things regarded among people .
>>es<< in other words , cars would not be of use in the future because of these types of transportation being developed and invented .
>>es<< they come together for a &apos;LAN-party &apos; with the neighbour &apos;s kids .
>>es<< also the lecture mentioned that the stone placed between the sphinx &apos;s front paws was not placed there during the time of the old kingdom &apos;s king , Khafre .
>>es<< but some young people do not give to helping their community .
>>es<< I give some of my time to help other people because I think it &apos;s very important .
>>es<< for example , here is one student , who knows fact but does not know how to ~ ?
>>es<< the first reason is that Groval warming did not connect with Anasazi disappearing .
>>es<< simply we need to eat and buy clothes , make and rise family .
>>es<< this happens more when one is watching a movies with the family .
>>es<< personally , I doubt that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today , based on my observations of falling vehicle prices , increasing population and stagnating rate of technological advance in the field of terrestrial transportation .
>>es<< I agree with that concept to take the risk and go for the new field .
>>es<< the size of the treasure written is too large .
>>es<< so it is very strange that why the poeple were able to live without enough water for 50 years , and then moved because they did n &apos;t have enough water .
>>es<< if they really interested in these courses , it &apos;s all right .
>>es<< therefore it is possible to believe that explosion of Tunguska was the explosion of asteroid .
>>es<< if someone is n &apos;t know eating is very important for growth bons and Brian or general for body it is fact but idease eating is just useful .
>>es<< advertising can be used badly not only by corporations but also by governments , as for exemple the nazi regime .
>>es<< he &apos;s the one who can give the different specialities the possibility to shine .
>>es<< such peole impressed other people through their strong well and divoution to duty .
>>es<< besides , smoke emitting from cars and the noise coming the car engines damage environment and the the health of people .
>>es<< the mainly reasons are such as following .
>>es<< it has come to be one of the effective measures manufatures use in selling their products .
>>es<< however , when I went to Canada by my self , I did many things that I wanted , so it was very exciting .
>>es<< it is not an easy task for old people to see young people sort of spending their time on useless things , in their opinion .
>>es<< for example , if you visit the ruins in Rome , without a tour guide you do n &apos;t realize the importance and the history behind these ruins .
>>es<< so that they have to pay more attention to their health rather than to enjoy arts .
>>es<< if your answer is yes , that is good .
>>es<< for example if the old person doesnot hear properly then young ones right from the day of their cihildhood think of inventing something that can help the older people hear more properly .
>>es<< right from the age of 5-6 years the children are busy with there curriculum .
>>es<< however , I firmly believe that traveling with guider is quiet beneficial because of it &apos;s posibillity to travel many places in a short time and safetiness .
>>es<< I have studed for just examination wayse studed .

>>es<< although , I often hurt in this time which thinking some question .
>>es<< my personal perception is that such a behaviour is damaging to a young person &apos;s personality , since it promotes uniformity and conformity , rather than creativity and innovation .
>>es<< facts helps us to know the utility or advantages of the product that has newly formed .
>>es<< the other is about the extreme lengths to conserve water .
>>es<< it is important for everyone to have faith in themselves and always look forward and not stay in one place .

>>es<< while studying at university , people may still do not know which subject they should specialize on .
>>es<< these activities are only for future or amusement of them .
>>es<< that is the bravery and being interested to all things .
>>es<< I will describe those two main issues : to meet the modern socity &apos;s needs and to be eligiable candidates for some companies .

>>es<< in order to maintain old buildings cost a lot of money .
>>es<< these factors can only contribute to growth in number of cars .

>>es<< it so happens very often that many companies are involved in making the same product and this means competition .
>>es<< why there is n &apos;t one that was left around Tunguska ?

>>es<< if they teach them , they will never forget it and it is benefitial for our country .
>>es<< I can not imagine that during the next 20 years anything could hinder a American to use his car to drive down to the post office which is only 3 blocks away .
>>es<< for instance , when I was elementary school , I learned mathmatics formura without concept .
>>es<< when you look at the Honda Civic &apos;s advertising , it looks fancy as Mercedes , too .
>>es<< that would be frequently asked qeuestion , so to answer this question we should be aware of the facts .
>>es<< however far we try to cast a view , gas has become a very expensive item that will even become more expensive .
>>es<< clearly , you must show you skills and by speaking .
>>es<< it is very important for theme to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
>>es<< rather than keep his investment within the confines of the oil bussiness where he is the master he went ahead with his new plan .
>>es<< therefore , if someone comes up with that breakthrough or innovative ideas , he will be the first to capitalize it .

>>es<< it can be good opportunity to make their own time to do anything .
>>es<< however , she also said that some kinds of birds are shrink .
>>es<< yet I am sure there are a number of exapmles of people who have achieved success that would prove the statement wrong .

>>es<< this is an effective solution to stop an advancing fires .
>>es<< this always chalanges the consumers to buy a perticular commodity in order to satisfy their needs and want in the morden days .

>>es<< it is possible that as the energy problem , the people &apos;s live styal will be changed .
>>es<< for example , When I was in school my geography book present ``Ploto &apos; &apos; as the last planet but the recent studies posted that`` Ploto &apos; &apos; is not a planet at all becouse of some different chracterictcs .
>>es<< but that does not mean that I do not respect and admire the others ..
>>es<< for example , in Korea , teachers teach something and students learn what teachers saying without dissussing with students while class .
>>es<< they do not need to know about what facts about that cake are .
>>es<< first , we can protect our enviroment by saving oil and gas
>>es<< to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , we can pick up more interesting fields about subject and it &apos;s too easy to understand .
>>es<< and I am completely disagree with what the auther want to say .

>>es<< for example banks have many very specialized departements .
>>es<< everybody would in the end benefit from their experience : people in general and people who wants to learn from them .
>>es<< boys and girls easy beleive them .
>>es<< in this time , my opiniom is young people enjoy life than older people do .
>>es<< more Informations how can we get it is the important things .
>>es<< they dont have to read spacific books and articles just because they love the topic .
>>es<< it is not bed if you know it , it means that your intelligence is high but a doctor has to be absolutely good at safing and helping ill persons .
>>es<< if however the student will put only conepts and his / hers ore someone elses ideas or concepts , which can be mistakes will make the professor think if the student actualy did what was asked from the assigment .
>>es<< we can just hope that those cars will have a new motor generation wich pollute less .
>>es<< when I watching TV , radion ...
