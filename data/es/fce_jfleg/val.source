>>es<< and thie critica use few arguments .
>>es<< secondly , the information in videos is very delivered in format , it very familiar with students .
>>es<< the heart decease patients shows improvement when they are taking placebo .
>>es<< besides , young people uaually like new-fasion thing , like iPod or MP 3 , I can see that main part of young peole ca n &apos;t live happily without music in their ear and movies at home .

>>es<< the advertisemnet says that the car has space for 1 0 people when thhe truth is that the car is just 4 people space , another example is an advertisement of a skin soap , they said that this soap is the best because they say your skin wil be as soft as a fifteen years old princess , or that your skin will be as soft as the Jennife Lopez &apos;s skin .

>>es<< the way I see it is that , the only thing that guides do is limit you , and even more when your in a group .
>>es<< these ideas and concepts usually contain academic research which are totally reliable and dependent on the facts .
>>es<< from this professor agreed some ideas and dis agreed some ideas .
>>es<< but , I went to Juju island more than three times .
>>es<< I would have a variety of answers subjective to every person field of interest .
>>es<< the second one is to specialize in one specific subject , one has his own tast in studing , so let us talk about this subject
>>es<< I think that the car , twenty years from now will use electric fuel not gasoline .
>>es<< after this effort , many companies in the world startet actions to get this ecocertify .

>>es<< after the contruction in 1 9 0 8 of the first commercial car the ford T , man -kind has been subdued to the use of the car .
>>es<< everybody loves him and he does the same .
>>es<< successful people had gone through lots of hardship .
>>es<< younger people are still trying to obtain experince although , olde have it already .
>>es<< hence ideas and concepts are more reliable than the facts .
>>es<< take toys for example , advertisments that target children in particular are the best example of the way advertisements create a false image of the product .
>>es<< the cars were our answer to the needs to transportation sixty years ago , and they will continue to be twenty more years from now .

>>es<< while turned out reaults from both experiences are same , the method and the time that brings a result is not same .
>>es<< because you do not need to be a hero in order to try new things , you just need to want it and know that any result will be a succes in things that you want or in learning .
>>es<< in a such situaction there is no other way .
>>es<< in the reach family all the components have a cars .
>>es<< I held the map and tried to find all the famous points that had marked on it .
>>es<< even the magnitides on Mars are no evidence of life on Mars .
>>es<< for example , When I traveled France and Italy alone , I met a person in Nice who was a famous producer of the song in Taiwan .
>>es<< finding oil and petrol and digging for it is a very expensive procedure .
>>es<< I hope those things I learned will help me in the future .

>>es<< because you share only a single interest , thus making you a loner .
>>es<< in addition , students want to learn the language and they want to use it , so when they understand the concepts and the ideas it will help them to learn the language .

>>es<< we can see young people working over countries or working for others with tools like telephones or internet even if they look they spend their time just for themselves by being whole day in their room .
>>es<< also , most of people prefer to entertain athletics rather than other arts .
>>es<< there fore , he likes to do arisky and strainge things and he enjoy it .
>>es<< but after a few days , I found myself enjoying in it .
>>es<< however , what if they just work for the field which they already know how to do well , they might feel sad and tired .
>>es<< I belive to have broad knowledge to specialize in one specific subject have outweigh than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
>>es<< in my opinion if someone thinks one is more important than other why not to focuse on one ?
>>es<< and people feel more arkward when it comes to their ears that this is something going on as a current event .
>>es<< however , I woud prefer traveling by myself with the good prepation filled with joy .

>>es<< Carusage in the United States is very important in every day life , aswell as in many LatinAmerican countries , and thirdworld countries .
>>es<< however , companies tend to cut thier profits for workers .
>>es<< the one is the copper scroll .
>>es<< another sollution could be the developing of more fuel efficient cars , wich could also be good for America &apos;s car manifacturers who will produce more attractive cars to sell to other countries .
>>es<< consequently , I agree the statement with regard to three reasons : effecting of view , face to face with people and the first time .
>>es<< thereby the problem of running out of fuels is out of the question thereby augumenting my view that the number of cars will continue to rise and not decline .
>>es<< first effection is grobal warming .
>>es<< so , Ho Chi Minh city will develope
>>es<< Peolple like to drive different types of models and they want some thinmg extra in it .
>>es<< these useful skills that I learned from reality are going to be the greatest gift for my future career , and they can not be found in the text books anyways .
>>es<< that &apos;s why i will not hard as i am alon .
>>es<< this is important thing .
>>es<< books some times have an old information so it will be wrong .
>>es<< against those problems , people started to use cheaper transportation instead of car .
>>es<< however , I agree that having knowledge is being useful whenever we necessary information .
>>es<< but when teacher ask me did I understand it , I said yes .
>>es<< so i disagree with the statement and i think it is much better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
>>es<< raising tax for the gas can be the most effective and possible way to decrease the use of gas in three reasons .
>>es<< next , kids are more attractive to the advertisements .
>>es<< successful People are explain any oher mater and discuss any other problem .
>>es<< but it dengerous , because some driver make trobull with other driver and they when some driver crash their car then streets are busy .
>>es<< because it is allready a fixed data so nobody can creat problem with this type of litreture .
>>es<< also , the professor indicates prescribed fire should be carful when we use prescribed fire solution .
>>es<< if they cannot pay the high prices any more , people have to change into a bus or a train .
>>es<< this will reduce the pollutions caused y the carbones from the cars .
>>es<< moreover they have to learn aboue advance course material .
>>es<< the age , in my view , sometimes is a barrier to do somethings in life .
>>es<< in simple words they say they lost their appeal .
>>es<< for example , nursing students study in a nursing college for three-four years .
>>es<< I believe , that the product &apos;s quality mentioned in the shops are exactly the same as given in the adds .
>>es<< then , define your goals and work hard to achieve them .
>>es<< critics of this policy focus in three poins ; first , Yellowstone fires scorched a large area of land therefore a lot of plant species were lost .
>>es<< in my past experiences , there are some lecture which is completely baed on facts , and the chance for me to apply them is just rare .
>>es<< when you understad de idea is one way that you can figurout about the statement that you see in these moment .
>>es<< however , a lot of reasons explain about that the placebo effect does .
>>es<< in todays world there is a high and almost unreplenishable thirst for change .
>>es<< firstly , I think that communities equal human rerationship .
>>es<< it may spoil the health also .
>>es<< water is needed for alive .
>>es<< I the same other people see many tims on TV rich people are intrested in politica , sports new technologies and also in spaise .
>>es<< as a result , studies in Britain have shown that fluoride increases the activity can lead to more bone density and therefore less bone fractures among the elderly .
>>es<< also , sometimes , people may meet some new friends in the traveling group .
>>es<< if students just learn facts , they will forget them soon , but this will not happen so easily if they understand properly the concepts that are behind the facts .
>>es<< as on when i started completing my home work on time i gradually improved .
>>es<< becase if study in this way of cours , I will gante so much , I also will have alot of information the book I study .
>>es<< when you understand the concepts and ideas is up to you to prove them , to see if they are really what you have been told , i think this is the main reason why students prefere facts rather than just understanding ideas and concepts .
>>es<< for example , if you are attempting to study arts and scienses and to get equalifications in both , you are extraordinary creation .
>>es<< Gouverment will try to do something to not pollute the air .
>>es<< so in this field it is very importnat to understand all concepts and idease which they gave us and use to solve problems .
>>es<< because they sent out 2 0 % of the whole carbon emission .

>>es<< it is also take risks raher than only doing .
>>es<< there will be a technological development in the future , but that will only promote the use of public transportation system , but not car .
>>es<< not being with a guide gives you the liberty to visit the places you want to visit at your own pace and with the liberty to deliberate to any place you want to go .
>>es<< usually in the advertisements a presentable face is used they try to present some modals , nice babies , known faces as sports men , only to let the product looks better than it was .
>>es<< not that bungee jumping is something that every young person wants to do but even if he wanted to do it he probably would n &apos;t be able to .
>>es<< close-up video clips of a juicy hamburger flying around the screen , surely satisfying the models eating it could easily create in the viewers a false sense of being hungry and urge them to hop into their car and drive to a fast food restaurant nearby to get what they have seen .
>>es<< as we all known when we were out something we ca n &apos;t expect would happen , such as disease , accident or something else .
>>es<< and then , makers of cars need to develop the systems for safe almost completely .
>>es<< third , the proffeser agrees that the the gas prices in the United States are cheep , and they should Rais them to safe the enviroment and people &apos;s healths .
>>es<< now a days , there are many people who think they are the most important thing and they only have to work for themselves .
>>es<< in general , there are many peples in a book .
>>es<< but they do things in a different maner than others which gives them success .
>>es<< people feel more secure and comfortable to tarvel with their own car rather that changing several public transportation vehicles and reach their destination far later that they would desire .
>>es<< the second critic of this method is that the costumer lose all critical reflex and that he is not in guard .
>>es<< I think it &apos;s harder for successful preson to risk somethnig , thay coluld lost much more then others .
>>es<< we can have glance on , what is happening in the world through accessing internet in mobile also .
>>es<< so the importance of communities in sosiety decreased .
>>es<< but found that successful people use the people money and use there idea for a way to success .
>>es<< in my case , when I did a job interview , the employer ask me question about commensence like society , policy , art , and so on .
>>es<< at some time they have to face the failure &apos;s and lot of strugles .
>>es<< because it transmit the hebitats from Eastern Europe to different places in the world .
>>es<< considering a family going shopping in weekend .
>>es<< the another reason is many people see some of exutic cars as luxery encorragies the industries .
>>es<< in my opinion , I think advertisements are make products seem much better than they really are .
>>es<< so , some people use car only by move somewher .
>>es<< they have to think twice before performing even routine activities of life .
>>es<< most of the actors , soldiers , workers and students are young people .
>>es<< to respond adequately to the world we live in we need to understand it first .
>>es<< Infact even today most of these systems runs on electricity which can be harnessed by several non polluting ways .
>>es<< comparing with older people , they do n &apos;t even have enough time to enjoy their life .
>>es<< also its been on all the sections because we use the head phones it makes alot of noise and it seriously very hard to stay on task .
>>es<< they are clean and big and so on .
>>es<< and rolling stone gather no mass says proverb .
>>es<< it is difficult only to watch educations .
>>es<< and there is a lot of critics concerned that the reqired testing is so long that declined the valueable for patients .
>>es<< I have a reason that study English .
>>es<< for example , little children are told that do not cross the street at red light , because it is so dangerous that we cannot let kids learn from crash .
>>es<< in my opinion students need to a knowledge .
>>es<< so because more people are able to buy cars the demand for cars will increase and so the production of cars will also increase and in the end this means that the number of cars will increase from now to twenty years time .
>>es<< first , they have spend many time on the computer , so they does n &apos;t know how to communicate .
>>es<< we know that prescribed burning shud be repreated every few years but its very expensive to spent every few year .
>>es<< second differance between the encylopedia is that there a lot of viruses and hackers in internet and one of the hackers can easily change the Informations about any kind of topic .
>>es<< if i want to win a case in court in - for example , a case where technical questions are to be considered- it is not enough to just know about the law .
>>es<< second , if there is any problem with the goods .
>>es<< some people might say &quot; hey how does energy come &quot; .
>>es<< the successful people try to do new things likr any machine can help the people .
>>es<< however , the problem is how long will it take us to find out that we are actually controlled by the advertisements and the perfect image they gave us ?
>>es<< hence , German students will have to work harder , think much more and thus become even more skilled .
>>es<< one reason is that endangered animals is breaking nature .
>>es<< so i think having selfconfdence is more important than having knowledge .
>>es<< a younger person however will need to time to define his or her wants in life .
>>es<< the work should be good , and not just bundle of meaningless .
>>es<< always natural disaster bring economy damage .
>>es<< its rightly said , life is not about adding years to life but life to years .
>>es<< first , advertissment make me to buy some thing unplanly .
>>es<< there are two major reasons : it is profit to socialization and mental health .
>>es<< for the these reasons , I have to take high score on TOEFL .
>>es<< I believe , this number is increasing and will continue to increase as generations of educated people pass on their wisdom to their children .
>>es<< in my opinion , the need for community service and volunteerism arises in the absence of adequate resources or when somebody is not fulfilling their responsibilities .
>>es<< when i consumed that drink , then i came to know that we should not believe the advertisements .
>>es<< they just creat impression such well that people are drag to buy it .
>>es<< since I liked enough areas inside , I bought the car a few days later .
>>es<< exactly like master of none and Jack of all .

>>es<< so the governments and the scientists are also promoting the less use of private cars as they are one of the greatest attributers to the air pollution .
>>es<< people use the public water to drink water .
>>es<< because this is not very easy to use .
>>es<< but in my opinion , if you want be a succussful people , you should have brave to try new things and take risks .

>>es<< do we consider her as a smart girl ?
>>es<< for example in a chemistry class when you talk about oxygen is needed for a burning process you can give a fact to support your idea which is you can put out a fire with a blanket by cutting the oxygen .
>>es<< who we mach them togather .

>>es<< it will be always puls things for them .
>>es<< there is going to be a huge market if the product is totally brand new , which is equal to a large chance to make more and lot &apos;s of money .
>>es<< before wasent like that , we was all tha times under the voluntad of the man , and depending economyc from him .
>>es<< when you are a teenager , you start experiencing some sexual changes , which in contrast changes your way of thinking , thinking more about the other gender than thinking about toys , would enjoy going out with some friends , than staying home playing with your toys .
>>es<< by avoiding this it will lead to much purer and natural world for our future generations to live in .
>>es<< firstly , some immergent events happening in the other countries or areas may happen in the place you live someday in future .
>>es<< I feel that with the environmentally friendly benefits and with the attachment that society already has on cars will make people keep riding cars .
>>es<< I do not want to go Effel Tower in Paris or The Statue of Liberty in New York when I travel because they are too famous , so I alerady heard and saw about them .
>>es<< others would like to spend more time shopping than going around the places .
>>es<< I feel this will give jobs to people also because all car companies would have to adjust with this change , from gas into water fuel use .
>>es<< so it is complex , looking after many new employee every year can be difficult .
>>es<< in this case the advertisement totaly make a impact in that baby .
>>es<< maybe they had enjoyed life in young times too .
