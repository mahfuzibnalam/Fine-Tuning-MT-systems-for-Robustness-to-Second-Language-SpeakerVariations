>>es<< the recreative part will begin at 10 pm with a short musical comedy performed by some of our students and end with fireworks launched from the roof of the college at 2 am .
>>es<< Appart of that , there is no recommendation as to what to wear .
>>es<< yours sincerely
>>es<< where are you ?
>>es<< due to the mobile phone .
>>es<< of course it allows to be reached everywhere ( even in places you would n &apos;t want . )
>>es<< but is n &apos;t it a handicap outside professional life .
>>es<< should n &apos;t people communicate with those they are next to instead of calling someone 2 miles away .
>>es<< would n &apos;t it be better to prepare the shopping list instead of dialing home to ask which salad to buy .
>>es<< mobile phone is a marvellous invention but as for cigarettes , we should right on it
>>es<< I am writing to reply your letter you wrote me on 10 June .
>>es<< firstly , I would like to tell you , that the group has been booked into Palace Hotel , which locates beside the congress house in the centre .
>>es<< secondly , the best way from the hotel to the conference is to take the bus , which is specially organized by us .
>>es<< off course there &apos;s also a bus number 8 in front of the hotel is also suitable , but it leaves only every half an hour .
>>es<< the end - of - conference party , which happens in the evening on 20 June , is going to be held on the coast .
>>es<< beside the barbecue , there are some well - known student bands from our country are performing music through the whole night .
>>es<< what &apos;s more is , that there &apos;s a Latin music band coming to make the party more colourful .
>>es<< it plays from 10 : 00 to 11 : 00 , while the students can enjoy it with dancing .
>>es<< the main events of the party will end up at about 12 : 30 in the night .
>>es<< finally , in the last afternoon , we could visit the museums , markets ( we have a very interesting robot - market ) .
>>es<< basically it &apos;s a free time for the students to look round here by themselves .
>>es<< I hope your questions re answered appropriatly .
>>es<< I &apos;m looking forward to seeing you on the conference .
>>es<< now - a - day computer can be found in almost every corner , in offices , in shops .
>>es<< or even in cars and washmachines there &apos;re computer chips .
>>es<< what has computer affected to our life ?
>>es<< first of all , the efficiency of the society has been improved .
>>es<< when shopping , we do n &apos;t need to wait the Kasse to take every article &apos;s note by hand .
>>es<< when booking a airline , we can just simply make a phone to any agency , and get it done in one minute .
>>es<< secondly , instead of looking up tons of books to get the information what we need , we can very easily search it from internet or on the local network .
>>es<< it &apos;s a very often heard , that someone , who has a special illness , gets operations by a foreign institutes , which he find via internet .
>>es<< moreover , with computer network , it can be possible that people work from home , making projects , controling operations or having conferences .
>>es<< lastly the way of communications has been also changed .
>>es<< instead of the tranditional telecommunication , we can talk , mail or even see each other with the help of computer network .
>>es<< of course there &apos;re also some aspects in which the computer technology need to be improved .
>>es<< for example , reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as on papers .
>>es<< a very important and severe problem is the reliability and security .
>>es<< till now , to completely rely on computer is still somehow not safe enough .
>>es<< in conclusion , computer have become a very essential necessity of our life , and it &apos;s still a young invention , which need to be improved .
>>es<< first at all , I am sorry about Richard illness .
>>es<< about your request , I &apos;m going to give you all the information that I think you must need , however you can call me if you consider it necessary , ( my phone number is 2496 9731 ) .
>>es<< because it is a wellkown hotel it should be easy to find it .
>>es<< moreover , it is really well - located so it will allow you to move around the city without any problem .
>>es<< even more the conference is going to take place in the Exhibition Centre , which is located only five minutes walking far from the Hotel .
>>es<< we haven &apos;t asked for any special clothes so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes , although you can come well - dressed , if you feel better .
>>es<< after the conference we are going to have an informal dinner with a previous snack time in order to introduce each others .
>>es<< finally in my opinion , you should visit the Art Gallery .
>>es<< I look forward hearing from you .
>>es<< &quot; Sagrada Familia &quot; a real holly building .
>>es<< if you are looking for a special building in Barcelona , which you can like whatever your tastes are , you should visit the &quot; Sagrada Familia &quot; .
>>es<< among the big number of choices , this unfinished church offers a gorgeous view fro the top of its towers , a charming story and one of the most representative examples of the Catalonia modernisme art .
>>es<< Gaudi conceived this church n 1912 , though it was n &apos;t until 1920 they started to build it .
>>es<< since the beginning the work was interrupted in different periods and started again .
>>es<< after Gaudi death it was critical stop which was fortunately solved three years later .
>>es<< nowadays , a hard work is being done in order to finish as soon as possible .
>>es<< the visitor can wonder around all the building or follow a guided visit .
>>es<< there is a exhibition room where maps and projects can be consulted .
>>es<< and , unless you suffer from your heart , you should climb the 350 steps which carry you to the top .
>>es<< there you can enjoy a terrific view , not only will you see almost all the city but also you will discover another perspective of this magnific building .
>>es<< as you know I am in charge for organise the conference in my college . do not worry if Richard did not left you all the information .
>>es<< we looked in every hotel in Town trying to give you the best offerd .
>>es<< we found two good hotels but we decided for the Palace Hotel .
>>es<< the conference day our school driver is going to pick you up in the hotel and take you to the conference .
>>es<< the party is going to be in a local discotheque near the college so the best way to get there is walking .
>>es<< you do not have to wear any special kind of clothes but in my opinion you can wear very cassual .
>>es<< finally , the last day I sugget you to go to the mall where you can enjoy shopping and looking around .
>>es<< the aim of this report is to recomend you to visit the Fuerte de San Diego Musseum .
>>es<< this is an historical building .
>>es<< I asked to some pleople in town and this was the best place to choose .
>>es<< the Fuerte de Sandiego Musseum was build at the time when the Spanish people was trying to take all the lands from Mexico , one of the most important people who was at front of the Fuerte was Hernon Cortez , the first Spanish in have more lands than anyone at that time .
>>es<< the Musseum is situated in front of the sea in the centre of Acapulco .
>>es<< is situated in the top of a little mountain in the &quot; old &quot; part on the city .
>>es<< you are able to get there by car or walking and see everything which was made at that time .
>>es<< on the whole this is the best building in Acapulco for his history and reputation .
>>es<< is the best place to go and easy to get there .
>>es<< my wish is that nothing goes wrong .
>>es<< your hotel is called Palace Hotel and it is placed in the city centre .

>>es<< the students have prepared a music program for the end - of - conference party .
>>es<< you will have a lot of fund , I can tell you .
>>es<< it is a way for people to communicate although they are at two different places .
>>es<< for example a telephone is very important in job - life .
>>es<< nowadays there are no companies which do not have a telephone .
>>es<< also it is god for people &apos;s safety .
>>es<< the people use the telephone also for their personal life .
>>es<< for example when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who live far away .
>>es<< they are able to give and receive Informations very quickly .
>>es<< the telephone has made my own life also easy and quick .
>>es<< finally I would say that the telephone is very efficient for people .
>>es<< the students can get there with the No 35 bus .
>>es<< they must get on the bus from the city centre and get off after five stations at Palace Station .
>>es<< at the end - of - conference the college , in which the conference will be held , gives a party for all the students .
>>es<< it will be offered light food , like sandwiches , pommes frites , chips , sweets and different drinks - no alcohol .
>>es<< there will be life music and the students can dance and enjoy themselves .
>>es<< the group can also visit the zoo , the opera or stay and relax at the college &apos;s enormous garden and enjoy the settings .

>>es<< history : at the castle are always few guides , who will show someone around and tell him about the history of the castle ( when it was built , by whom and why ) , which makes everyone enthousistic .
>>es<< I recomment to visit this castle , because it is interesting , marvelous and something different .
>>es<< Nyremberg is also famous for this castle and the students will have a different expirience and a lesson too .
>>es<< by the way you can visit the
>>es<< I would get you the information you are requested .

>>es<< I am glad to helping you for the organisation of the international student conference .

>>es<< at the end - of - conference there is a party , where we can eat something , dance and speak to each other about the conference .
>>es<< for the party I suggest you to wear classic clothes ; maybe something black and not red or pink . I am going to wear black classic trousers and a white jorsey - it can be that this information give you some idea too ..
>>es<< on the last day we are going to have about three hours free times .

>>es<< I think that these suggestions could interest your student then Biasco , with its , , Casa cavalier Pellanda &quot; , is the middle points of two tailes - Leventina and Blenio - and the middle points of two similar but also different cultures too .
>>es<< I hope that these Informations will bring you to visit Biasco and its , , house &quot; .
>>es<< yours faithfully ,
>>es<< I am sorry to hear that Richard Brown is n &apos;t well and hope he &apos;ll get better soon . I am more than happy to give you the nessessary information .
>>es<< your group has been booked into Palace Hotel which is only 2 miles away from our college .
>>es<< the college will arrange a mini - bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8 : 45 , so you can arrive to the college around 9 o &apos;clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9 : 15 .
>>es<< the reason we do n &apos;t suggest you to take a walk from your hotel is that you &apos;d have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students .
>>es<< as you already know we are going to have the end - of - conference party where the Head of the college will give a small speech at the begining , then it will a buffet and a disco .
>>es<< you do n &apos;t need to dress up smartly but please , make sure that your students do n &apos;t wear short or trainers .
>>es<< regarding to what you could do in your free afternoon on the day you leave I would suggest you to take the students to our History Museim .
>>es<< there is also a gift shop in there , where your boys and girls can buy some soveniers for their families and friends .
>>es<< I hope I &apos;ve answered all your questions but if you need anymore information , please let me know .
>>es<< to my personal opinion one of the most important and useful thing which has been invented in a car .
>>es<< cars take a big part in our life .
>>es<< more and more people learn how to drive and choose to travel by car , because it saves a lot of time comper to travelling by public transport .
>>es<< you do n &apos;t have to wait on a bus stop on a cold and windy weather for a late bus , or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some Railtrack repairs , you can just jump into a car , tune your radio onto your favourite station and have a plesant drive to your distanation .
>>es<< cars are even more important for emergency situations such as fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill .
>>es<< there was no public transport and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time , and relay on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else .
>>es<< there I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted a quality life for my daughter and myself .
>>es<< I use my car every day everywhere I go and I absolutelly love it !
>>es<< I am writing to inform you some information about an international student conference .
>>es<< it is very near York Railway Station which you can get there easily .
>>es<< by rail : get off at York station and you can walk from the station turn left and the hotel is on your left hand side .
>>es<< secondly , the conference is very important event for all of us , we agree to wear formal dresses .
>>es<< for example , men should wear suits , ties and the so on .
>>es<< it would be grateful If we could go for a walk around the city of York and visit the historic buildings .
>>es<< if you could think of any other ideas It would be very kind of you . I would be grateful if my idea and all the information could help you .
>>es<< nowadays , a lot of things are invented and make our lives are more convenient than those days .
>>es<< a car is one of the invention which is very useful .
>>es<< for example , I can travel to many places in the U.K. Especially , I live in Whitwell - on - the - Hill ( a village near Malton in North Yorkshire ) .
>>es<< can you imagine if I had n &apos;t got a car how could I go shopping , go to college and so on ?
>>es<< in fact , there are buses ( number 843 and 845 ) which go pass my village but the bus fares is very expensive for me .
>>es<< apart from that it takes long time to go somewhere .
>>es<< the car has largely affected my own life .
>>es<< I can go anywhere by car a lot quicker than use public transports .
>>es<< I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music which I brought some cassets with me from Thailand .
>>es<< I took a car driving theory test last October and I passed it and I will take a pratice driving test very soon .
>>es<< I think I have to drive the car myself , so that it will know more about the advantages of using the car .
>>es<< in conclusion , I think car is very important to me and it has affected my own life .
>>es<< if I have more money I will buy another car . I think it has more advantages than disadvantages .
>>es<< so , we should say many thanks to the person who invented a car !
>>es<< it was such a pleasure to receive your letter , and we will be extremely glad to see you at the conference , we have been organising .
>>es<< is called Palace Hotel , and we hope that is going to satisfy your expectetions .
>>es<< I strongly reccommend you to use the public transportation in order to get there , cause you may be find other types of transportation quite expensive .
>>es<< moreover , you must be aware of the fact that the conference is going to last two hours , untill 10 : 00 pm .
>>es<< after that our college has organised a barbequiou night , with traditional local music that you must not miss .
>>es<< just every day clothes .
>>es<< finally , I am aware of the fact that the last day you have some hours free before you catch your plane .
>>es<< there is also huge shop centre , where you can buy some souvenirs or taste some of our traditional food .
>>es<< I hope that you will find my information helpfull
>>es<< I &apos;am looking forward to seeing you
>>es<< your sincerely

>>es<< the other suggestion is going to the flower market where is very famous for tourists because it covers 2 acres and there are plenty of flowers to buy .
>>es<< there are many sources of light in this world such as sunlight , moonlight , candle light .
>>es<< owing to increasing demand of light for more activities , the natural source is not adequate .
>>es<< there , electric light has invented .
>>es<< nowadays , the electric light has been becoming part of our lives , especially during the night .
>>es<< whatever we do at night , we need the electric light .
>>es<< have you ever imaged how this world would be if there was no electric light ?

>>es<< secondly , the end - of - conference party will be held at college main hall , at 8 : 00 pm to 11 : 30 pm on 20th June .
>>es<< furthermore , I suggest you and the students wearing pub - wears to it , as it is suitable for dancing .

>>es<< I had a problem with my best friend once when we keep in tuch through e - mail .

>>es<< I always had consider myself been very looky to be born in the Century because all the amaizing human inventions .
>>es<< as an example let &apos;s have a look and we will see of this nation how it has developed .
>>es<< however I feel that at the moment there should emerge more grups to control this development because the industrial polution that it has been created and it seems that its very little what has been done at the moment in relation to our embiroment .
>>es<< I think that we have to think which hotel is better for the students .
>>es<< it has comfortable bedrooms and place for parties .
>>es<< you can book this hotel it &apos;s the best and it &apos;s near to conference it &apos;s only 15 minutes by walk .
>>es<< I think that it will be nice about the end - of - conference party if you will invite somebody to sing and give to the student the time to enjoy theirselves and to dance .
>>es<< the party it will be nice .
>>es<< the clothes now that they will wear it has to be smart , not how you are going to casino for example but nice casual , not with sports shoes or T - shirts .
>>es<< on the last day in the afternoon that you have three ours free you can go for coffee or to visit some places .
>>es<< I hope that you will like it .
>>es<< your sincerely ,
>>es<< today our article it will be about an inventions that we need inour life .
>>es<< I think that all this things we need in our life because it can give us a lot of things .
>>es<< first of all we need the telephone in our house because it &apos;s important to make call if you need something of if it something happend to your house and nobody is next to you .
>>es<< in the past the people did n &apos;t have electicity and if they wanted for example to read or to cook something they used to do in the fire .
>>es<< it &apos;s important to have electricity because without this you ca n &apos;t do anything .
>>es<< you must have TV because you can liten what it happend in the world and you can watch some places that you did n &apos;t go .
>>es<< you can enjoy you time to watch a film if you have free time .
>>es<< the boat it &apos;s not so important but you can use it for fishing and to see some places .
>>es<< the car now is very important in our life you can go wherever you want .
>>es<< in this year the familys they have 3 cars in one family one by one person .
>>es<< for me the most important thing is the telephone because without this you ca n &apos;t do anything , it &apos;s part of my life .
>>es<< it has a swimming - pool and a nice bar .
>>es<< the hotel is ten minutes far from the conference and there will be a bus available to go directly over there .

>>es<< we have the possibility to visit the old town , it &apos;s very nice and there is a lot of shops .
>>es<< I think it &apos;s good for old people because some of them can not go to the cinema anymore .
>>es<< in one hand it &apos;s because they have not enough money to pay it and in the other hand it &apos;s because they ca n &apos;t move very well for example if they are disabled .
>>es<< with television , old people are less alone because most of old woman have not her husband anymore .
>>es<< television is a good way to be informed with the news .
>>es<< I prefer being informed by television than by newspapers , it &apos;s more relaxing .
>>es<< I think television is a good invention for children when they have free time and while they are watching television , we do n &apos;t have to look after them if we have something important to do .
>>es<< I &apos;m very glad to be able to help you out with such sutiation .

>>es<< when you arrive to the Colleges there will be people indicating the way to the conference room .
>>es<< at the end of the conference we are doing a party with some cold good and some drinks .
>>es<< the director of the College has suggested to wear smart clothes for that occasion and I give you the same advice .

>>es<< the conference will take one hour , and , at 8 o &apos;clock the party will start , it is a formal party and you should wear formal stuff .
>>es<< the dress code is : no jeans .

>>es<< your sincerely ,
>>es<< apart from being in - fashion it is also a very helpful machine .
>>es<< what would you have done in that moment without a mobile phone ?
>>es<< all over , the invention of this little device is a big plus for everyone .
>>es<< I am writing to inform you that I have recieved a letter from you about helping you to organise an international student conference in my college .
>>es<< your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is not very far from my college .
>>es<< however , due to the congestions and delay near the hotel , the best way to get from there to the conference is by underground , Victoria Street station .
>>es<< you would arrive at the other station opposite my college in approximately 15 minutes .
>>es<< all different types of clothing could be worn however Jean wears and T - shirts would be common on that day .
>>es<< instead staying in the hotel for the last three hours , I suggest that you could perhaps visit our town centre .
>>es<< the popular attractions in our town , including the art gallery , museum , aquarium , market square , could be found near our monument of our town , the Saltisy Bridge .
>>es<< I am looking forward to see you soon .

>>es<< for those who want something more exciting and advanturous , you are recommanded to visit the fun Fair and amusement on the top floor of the building .
>>es<< other facilities such as cinemas , theatres , large department stores could also be found .
>>es<< there is a little souvenir shop for tourists and a special discount for tourists from aboard to enter the car park .
>>es<< not only the tourist information centre would provide the information you might need , you could also visit the ICT block which allows you to access onto anything you want to know from the computers .
>>es<< I am writting in connection with your letter bout the international student conference .
>>es<< I would like to give you necessary details , which can help you to organise the conference .
>>es<< Richard Brown booked the Palace Hotel for the students , which is a very comfortable and close to our college .
>>es<< you need only 5 minutes by walking to catch the college .
>>es<< after conference we are planning to organise a big party with barbecue .
>>es<< the party will take place on forest close to camping place .
>>es<< I hope we will have a nice weather .
>>es<< therefore , I suggest to wear some casual clothes .
>>es<< on the last day an afternoon if you have some free time I would recommend you to visit a very famous exposition of Leonardo Devinci .
>>es<< the exposition will take place on &quot; Gribaldi museum &quot; , which you can find on the Crariden street N 5 .
>>es<< you will never regred about my suggestion .
>>es<< if you need more information let me knowe .
>>es<< report on the building at the Berkeley Square .
>>es<< in order to prepare this report I visited the business college and interviewed some students , I asked them only one question &quot; Which building do you find more beautiful and more interesting in our city ? &quot;
>>es<< the Students , who were questioned said that there are a lot of interesting buildings in our City .
>>es<< however the majority of people point out one a very old building , which you can find at Barkeley Square .
>>es<< most of the Students found this building very particular , because it reflects our history , tradition and culture .
>>es<< if you visit the building , you will get impression , feeling , that you are in past times .
>>es<< this building attracts a lot of people , - because it has a very particular style with majestic , antique windows .
>>es<< finally I would recommend you visited Barkely Square area .
>>es<< in this area you could also find another different buildings , which would you attract .
>>es<< report on the group leader
>>es<< I &apos;ve recieved your letter asking me for further information about the conference that you going to organise very soon , here yo have a little help for it .
>>es<< at first , I &apos;d like to tell you that the hotel where you going to stay is &quot; The Palace Hotel &quot; , wich is situated at the center of the town .
>>es<< it ca n &apos;t be difficult to find , because is very near of the conference .
>>es<< also there is a bus provided for the organisation to take all the students at the hotel .
>>es<< at the end of the conference it will be a party .
>>es<< I might suggest you to wear a casual dress , because many students feels relaxing after the whole day sitting and listening all the conference .
>>es<< the party is amazed by a group of musicians , and as I remembered from last year it was unforgiven , because all the people where dancing and having a lot of fun .
>>es<< it is a well - situated town with a lot of museums to visit especially &quot; the History museum &quot; wich I visited last year , and I think you can enjoy as well .
>>es<< it does n &apos;t take a lot of time to visit and the entrance is free .
>>es<< Whising I &apos;ve been very helpful to you .
>>es<< telephone change our LIFES
>>es<< it &apos;s imposible Nowdays to think a life without that invention how quickly affects our life especially in business .
>>es<< we ca n &apos;t imagine a big company without a phone , that can makes business more quickly than anything else .
>>es<< also , I was asking too many people in the street .
>>es<< could you live without telephone ?
>>es<< the answer was all the same &quot; Imposible &quot; .
>>es<< an old woman told me how important was the phone when her only son was abroad studing computers in the &quot; Chicago University &quot; , she told me that every night was expecting a call from her son , for her was the line of the hapiness .
>>es<< however it was one persone wich he told me , it was n &apos;t happy at all with the phone , because he used to writte a lot , especially at Christmas to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phone him losing a very old fashion .
>>es<< in my opinion this little &quot; box &quot; that everybody has at home can safe your life , especially if you need to ring a doctor in an emergency situation .
>>es<< in conclusion do n &apos;t make a very long phone calls and you Wo n &apos;t have to pay a very expensive bill .
>>es<< then I will give you some information which you asked for in your letter .
>>es<< firstly , about your accomodation , our college which I belong to offers visitor free accomodations with full of facilities .
>>es<< ( for example bath , car park , free internet access , etc . )
>>es<< they also are located in our campus so you can get to the conference by walk .
>>es<< secondly , as you know we &apos;ll have a party after the conference , which will be taken place at our student council hall with some meals .
>>es<< this party is unlikely to be that formal , but I recommend you not to wear jeans and trainners .
>>es<< at last , if you have free time for couple of ours , you &apos;d better visit Kamakura City , which is 30 minutes from our campus by train .
>>es<< that is very traditional Japanese city where so many temple and heritages are there .
>>es<< I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll enjoy it and maybe get familier with our culture .
>>es<< these days , we &apos;ve been sorrounded with so any different kinds of products which our ancestors invented .
>>es<< in our daily life , however , we seldom notice how much convinient life we &apos;ve got , what is more , how much inconvinient our grandparents had got .
>>es<< let us try to appreciate thier importance again .
>>es<< as for me , the invention which is most important to me is a personal computer . I have been a full time student in the university at home , and their classes all requires us to have personal computer and use them at any times .
>>es<< when you take the class on computer programming , you will definetly need one and it holds true for the class on politics , because you have to study statistic on your computer for doing social research and some analysys .
>>es<< my professor said &apos; go and get familier with your computer , otherwise you &apos;ll fail &apos; .
>>es<< I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we useually use without any questione .
>>es<< that &apos;s the nature of human being .
>>es<< but , I think it &apos;s not only our fault but the evidence of how much they integrate in our life .
>>es<< dear Mrs smith
>>es<< I received your letter asking some information about conference
>>es<< I am glad to provide all information
>>es<< the group has been booked the place Hotel which is near the train station .
>>es<< it is really easy to reach to the conference from the hotel .

>>es<< in the conference you should wear formal dress but you are free to choose its colour or style .
>>es<< at the end of the conference there will be reseption at the hotel .
>>es<< we have arranged some tours in the city .

>>es<< yours faithfully .
>>es<< can you imagine the life before computer .
>>es<< lots of books , papers , many things on the tabels .
>>es<< computer is really claver machine .
>>es<< he store all information , never say enough and it never forget any information , whenever we want them from him he dosn &apos;t refuse .
>>es<< he saves time for humankind People do n &apos;t need to spend a lot time to record everything , it makes space in offices .

>>es<< this saves a lot money for companies .

>>es<< below is a piece of information you will need for the next international student conference at Bournemouth College and some recommendations , which might be useful for the students .
>>es<< people are going to be disguised there and it would be a good idea to wear extravagant multi - coloured clothes .
>>es<< finally I think that you should jump at opportunity to go to the historical Pergam &apos;s Museum before leaving .
>>es<< some of the most amazing masterpieces are exposed there .
>>es<< I wish you in advance a wonderful trip and look forward to meeting you in Bournemouth .
>>es<< your sincerely
>>es<< below is a summary of the most important relevant points and some recommendations you may need .
>>es<< the architecture of the building in itself is really breathtaking in terms of luxury and ornamentation choice .
>>es<< even if the architectural style may seem a bit &apos; heavy , this building is really a masterpiece with no similar comparison all over the world .
>>es<< although I have to admit that it is very tiring to visit the whole museum in one day , it is such a rewarding and enriching time that people get never tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures of each section of the museum .
>>es<< the adjoining restaurant is very enjoyable as well .
>>es<< to sum up , I would say that this museum is more interesting than the other museums , because you can enjoy not only wonderful masterpieces but also a very uncommon architecture and a quiet restaurant to have a rest if you need to .
>>es<< firstly , the hotel in which the group is going to stay is &apos; Palace Hotel &apos; .
>>es<< there is a bus stop in front of the hotel and no.31 or 3 will take you directly to the conference .
>>es<< thirdly , the end - of - conference party would be a small disco , with a variety of drinks and food provided .
>>es<< therefore , you could wear something quite casual .
>>es<< lastly , on the last day , I would suggest you to visit the Edinburgh Castle and the National Scottish Museum , as both of them are very interesting and have the student discount .
>>es<< I hope this letter should help you with enough information .
>>es<< only people who could live without it , must be extremely weird or somebody in a very difficult situation !
>>es<< we are nearly always surrounded by the &apos; man - made &apos; light .
>>es<< today , this kind of thing hardly happens !
>>es<< well , unless there was n &apos;t anything wrong with the power supply .
>>es<< while I was in toilet , all the light was turned off !
>>es<< I screamed and cried since I &apos;d never experienced being in a complete darkness before .
>>es<< when the light was turned on again , I realised how important even a single light bulb would be , and I was sure I can never , ever live without it .
>>es<< in replied of your letter , I will try to give you some advices .
>>es<< the conference will take place not far from the hotel so you will see indications to follow .
>>es<< for the conference , I suggest you to wear a beautiful dress , because there will be important persons of others colleges .
>>es<< at the end of the conference , all students and leader will have a drink .
>>es<< to finish , if you have spare time , you could walk on the center of Poitiers which is very beautiful .
>>es<< I hope I give you enough details .
>>es<< I look forward to meeting you on the conference .
>>es<< it &apos;s a modern building with an architecture that you ca n &apos;t see in other place .
>>es<< what is impressive on this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building .
>>es<< on the Pompidou &apos;s center , there are different expositions on different themes .
>>es<< this expositions are often very attractive and they change every year .
>>es<< another good point , if you go there you will have an extraordinary view on the city .
>>es<< so if you visit Paris , the Pompidou &apos;s center is a very interesting building to visit , even if in Paris there are many others buildings .
>>es<< as the conference must go on , I will give you the information you asked for in order to work on with this conference .
>>es<< according to the hotel , the group has been arranged to stay in a hotel which is very near the place we are going to have the conference .
>>es<< it &apos;is just only 5 minutes walk from there to the conference and I would like to suggest that this is the best way to get to the conference .
>>es<< about the party , we will have a party at the end of the conference at the hotel you will stay .
>>es<< the party will be in a friendly atmosphere so do n &apos;t worry about what to wear .
>>es<< there will be only our group , so dress whatever you want and enjoy ourselves .
>>es<< the shopping centre is just right opposite of the hotel , however , some people may want to just wait at the hotel , having a cup of coffee .
>>es<< I hope that information will be useful .
>>es<< how would you manage to get yourself ready to go to work .
>>es<< how would you know what happens in the whole wide world or even how you would get yourself breakfast without toaster ! ! !
>>es<< how would you cope with all those ?
>>es<< thank god for those who had created the electricity and had appliedapplied it into every appliances .
>>es<< the electricity is a clever invention .
>>es<< everything bases on the use of electricity , for instance from a little bulb light to the most complicated computer system which stored priceless information !
>>es<< the electricity is very important in keeping our lives go .
>>es<< no matter where you are , what you do , apparantly , you need the electricity .
>>es<< let &apos;s think this way , if we did n &apos;t have the electricity , there would be no other inventions at all ! !
>>es<< I , personally , could n &apos;t live without the electricity .
>>es<< it has already affected and play a great role in my life .
>>es<< I watch the television and use the computer everyday .
>>es<< moreover , other facilities in my house , telephone , air - conditioner , fridge , for example , they are all need the electricity . that &apos;is why it is very important to my life .
>>es<< my name is ... , I am a local student and i will give you the requested information .
>>es<< the rooms for your students have been booked at the Palace Hotel near the city - centre .
>>es<< the hotel is just three busstops away from our college .
>>es<< so you and your students can take the bus from the central busstation that is right in front of your hotel to get to the conference .

>>es<< sometime &apos;s early in the morning until late in the evening .
>>es<< yes it is the TV .
>>es<< it is well know in almost all family , often with a lot of different cannels .
>>es<< first of all , the TV can tell us news in a short time , what happened all over the world .
>>es<< another point in favour of the invention for the TV is , that they telling about interesting reports , for instance about animals or different culture from other countrys .
>>es<< furthermore they have a lot of different programme , usually something for everybody .
>>es<< it could be also relaxing to sit on the sofa after a busy day at work .
>>es<< finally , the TV is in my opinion very useful for getting important information , you can watching the weather and all of them were present in wonderful colour .
>>es<< however , they send a lot of violence which is not good for the children .
>>es<< I can not imagine to live without televison , it is something what we need for our education , for getting news and other helpful information .
>>es<< surely I &apos;ll try to help you as good as I can .
>>es<< first , I tell you the name of the hotel , it &apos;s the Palace Hotel .
>>es<< for getting from the hotel to the conference , you only have to take bus no.7 and get off at St. James College , where the conference will take place .
>>es<< about the end - of - conference party I can only say that a band will be playing the whole night , and a special guest I still do n &apos;t know will be expected .
>>es<< I suggest to wear casual clothes , I think there &apos;s no need of school uniforms .
>>es<< to answer your last question , I would propose you to attend the local zoo , because many baby animals were born in the past few days .
>>es<< dear Mrs Smith , I hope the given information is useful for you .
>>es<< could you imagine there &apos;s no telephone ringing in an office ?
>>es<< or to live your live without chatting for hours with your best friend ?
>>es<< I ca n &apos;t !
>>es<< the telephone was invented by Alexander Graham bell in the end of the 19th century .
>>es<< it was an invention nobody thought how important and how widespread it would be in future .
>>es<< nowadays almost every household in the western world owns a telephone , and calling to relatives or friends spread all over the world is no strange thing .
>>es<< people need the telephone not only for chatting , but also for exchanging information in a very short and direct way with the possibility to answer immediately .
>>es<< now I have my own flat , and the first piece of furniture I &apos;ve bought was the telephone . I &apos;ll never take it away from my home .
>>es<< dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
>>es<< I want to inform you that I had already talked to Richard Brown and he informed me about the conference .
>>es<< next week I will be start organising some events for this conference .
>>es<< the event will organize at the Palace Hotel .
>>es<< the same hotel that will you stay .
>>es<< palace Hotel is opposite the park `Clifton &apos; , which is near the college .
>>es<< we chose that hotel because is it near the college and we do n &apos;t need to use a transport .
>>es<< because you know where is the college and you need to bring with me some things at the college to hotel I think that is better to come all the group in college and then we can go all together to the `Palace Hotel &apos; .
>>es<< the conference start at 9 : 00 o &apos;clock you need to be at the college half an hour before .
>>es<< concerning the end - of - conference I &apos;m thinking about some dance and singing events .
>>es<< tell me your idea .
>>es<< about the clothes that we need to wear , must be uniform , because is the best conference to London and every year are coming lectures from other colleges .
>>es<< finally on the last day we have organised a seeing - crossing around London . you will have the opportunity visiting some museums and zoo parks .
>>es<< if you want more information you can call me my telephone number is 047 * * * . please if you have more ideas send me a letter .
>>es<< yours sincerely ,
>>es<< Nowdays all the people have a telephone .
>>es<< telephone is part of our life .
>>es<< it is one of the most important investigation all over the world .
>>es<< telephone is type of communication .
>>es<< if you want to talk with your friends , parents , partner or to ask something , you can call them without wondering how can be communicate with them .
>>es<< especial if some of your relatives or friends are living in other country you can communicate with them and everyday and you do n &apos;t feel that they are far a way from you .
>>es<< today with the development of technology has been improved and the abilities of the telephone .
>>es<< they are telephones that you have the opportunity to talk with more than one people at the line .
>>es<< also you can leave a message if you call and ca n &apos;t find someone .
>>es<< the last type of telephone , is the mobile phone .
>>es<< you can use it everywhere and at anytime .
>>es<< finally telephone except &#124; apart from type of communication , is type and socialisation .
>>es<< nowadays who are so bussy and we do n &apos;t have free time to see our friends , we can call them and talk or chat with them .
>>es<< especial the young people are using many hours the telephone and that is trouble for their parents .
>>es<< telephone is very important investigation if we can use it correct without use it as type of entertaiment as they are doing nowadys many people .
>>es<< as you know , a hotel whose name is Palace Hotel has been booked for your group .
>>es<< the party will be formal , therefore you have to wear formal clothes like a suit or a dress .
>>es<< as you know , it is not suitable to wear a Jean or something .
>>es<< on your last day you have an afternoon free .
>>es<< I hope you will find all the details , which you would like to have in the letter .
>>es<< if you need any information , please let me know .
>>es<< your sincerely ,
>>es<< power Of Computurs .
>>es<< how much can a computer affect your life ? I think it effects more than you think .
>>es<< I felt lack of them .
>>es<< I first bought a computer as I was in university .
>>es<< it was so necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer .
>>es<< that time I met the magic world of computers .
>>es<< linking to the internet was so popular .
>>es<< Internet was something amazing for me .
>>es<< can you think you have every information you need whenever you want ?
>>es<< can you think you contact with anyone who is from any country whenever you want ?
>>es<< I meet a lot of people on internet and it really interest me .
>>es<< I learn a lot about their culture by speaking them on internet .
>>es<< in addition this , today companies can do nothing without a computer .
>>es<< everything in this world works with computers from now on .
>>es<< computers changed my life style , my opinion about the world .
>>es<< and they effect everyone &apos;s life directly or indirectly .
>>es<< first of all the hotel is the Palace Hotel , 82 Regent Street , so that it is very easy to reach the conference .
>>es<< in fact you can take the bus number 3 ; as you can see , the bus stop is just in front of the hotel , then you can get off immediately after the church that you pass , on your right hand .
>>es<< secondly , we will have the party in the hotel at 8.00 o &apos;clock and a buffet will be served at 8.30 p.m. It would be also possible to get some vegetarian food and drink cocktails free of charge . I would recommend your students to bring their Identity Card to prove their age .
>>es<< what is more , I would suggest to wear very smart dress and for men it is oblidged the tie .
>>es<< finally , if I were you I would go shopping to the City Centre to spend your last hours .
>>es<< however , if you re interested in Archeology you should vitis the History Museum in Garden Square .
>>es<< have you ever thought to live without your car ?
>>es<< I the last fourty years people seem to be completely addicted by using their own car .
>>es<< it is said that the majority of the citizens has got a car and unfortunately this is the reason why cities are getting more polluted .
>>es<< on the other hand , this kind of facility has made our life more comfortable and easy .
>>es<< in fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carring lugguage and shopping bags .
>>es<< cars are able to cover not only short distance but also can be used for long journey .
>>es<< for example , in the past it would had been extremely exhausting travelling riding a hourse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of optionals to choose with .
>>es<< however , I have to say that it has made people be lazy and at the same time stressed due to the traffic .
>>es<< on the other hand one of the main advantages is that we can save time and money as cars have long last and allowe us travelling quickly .
>>es<< that &apos;s why I could n &apos;t image my life without it .
>>es<< if student is ill , we will return the money but you should tell us untill one week before we start .
>>es<< and you are staying the Palace Hotel , which is located in town Centre .
>>es<< if you take public buses , it costs more expensive than school bus .
>>es<< one of our teacher , who will be voted by student is making speech for one hour .
>>es<< after , student is making speech about what he or she have learned. and Diner .
>>es<< in my opinion , you should wear normal cloth .
>>es<< I would like to suggest that you should visit building of sixty two which is consisted on sixty second floor .
>>es<< there are eye - Max cinema , museums , garelty .
>>es<< I look forward to hearing soon from you .
>>es<< Pusan Castle is locted in South of Pusan .

>>es<< dear Mrs Maria Smith
>>es<< with reference to your letter which I recived yesterday , I would like to give you some details about The international student conference , also the acomodation and activities that are planed during this week .
>>es<< the Hotel that is booked for the students it is one of the beast in the area , it has great facilities and it is situated near to the place where the conference is going to be .
>>es<< the best way to get there from The hotel is by bus and it is already booked for the next day you arrive , at 8 : 30 am .
>>es<< about the party which is just at the end of the conference , a good it would be a dance party and the students do n &apos;t really need to wear special clothes , it &apos;s just to have a little dance and meet all the students , after the party there is a small trip to the old part of the city and I think it would be a good choice to spend the last three hours that you have left before go back .
>>es<< I hope this letter aswer all your questions , if you whant to know more about it just give me a call or send me a letter .
>>es<< your sincerely
>>es<< the aim of this report is to give some information about The new Acapulco resart buildings which was build 10 years ago and it is one of the first buildings that was build with the latest tecnonology and made by a important Mexican arquitector .
>>es<< in addition the resort has an interesting History background about arquitectory and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico for example , it provides differents kinds of tours around Mexico .
>>es<< on the contrary it is far away from the city and it has difficult transport facilities .
>>es<< in spite of the disadvantages , I would strongly recomended to students and public to visit the new Acapulco resort buildings. and have a great experience knowing about buildings history and at the same time traveling around Mexico .
>>es<< I am afraid to hear that Mr. Brown is ill I hope it Wo n &apos;t be grave .
>>es<< the name of the hotel in which the group is going to stay in is Palace Hotel , to get there you must go to the centre of town , all buses are going there , Once you are in the centre Palace Hotel is right in front of the tourism information office .
>>es<< for the end - of - conference party we have booked one of the halls of the hotel and they will provide us life music and cattering .
>>es<< due the hotel is such an elegant place I would suggest to dress up in night clothes .
>>es<< finally , to fill your free afternoon I would hardly recomend to visit the cathedral and have a walk arround the old part of the city , if you like it will be my pleasure to show you the souroundings .
>>es<< chairs are not only part of the forniture , they are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums as art symbols .
>>es<< in fact , nobody has got this clue , but it must have been the most clever person on earth !
>>es<< the world is packed with so many tipes of chairs , from the common woden ones to the most sophisticate and comfortables others finding a baste range of prices .
>>es<< from my point of view the chair is without a doubt the most usefull gadget ever invented .
>>es<< some people use them in their work , others are wishing to get one by the end of the day and for some other people a while chair represents the possibility of mouvement .
>>es<< although is worth to say that not everybody can chose his ideal chair there is a special one for each of us .
>>es<< I am glad to help you for the organisation of the conference .
>>es<< I phoned to the tourist information last week and I got some information about the accomodation of the students .
>>es<< I think we should book at the Palace Hotel .
>>es<< the Hotel is in a good position , 10 minutes walk from the conference and I think the best way to reach it is on foot .
>>es<< I think they should wear smart dress , because there will be lots of interesting people and important meeting .
>>es<< in conclusion , for the last day , I thought it will be very interesting for the students to visit the town and appreciate its monuments and art .
>>es<< on the other hand , if you prefer to have a relaxing day , you could have a PIC - NIC in the wonderful park .
>>es<< I hope my suggestion and Idea will help you to organise the meeting .
>>es<< as requested , the aim of this report is to assess the suitbility for a group of American students for the visit at the Etruscan Museum .
>>es<< Populoniou is about 15 Km. from Piombino and it can be reached by well - organised means of transport .
>>es<< the Etruscan Museum is one of the most attractive building in my town .
>>es<< it contains lots of archeological Etruscans founded and some remains about Etruscans neoropolis .
>>es<< the entrance fee is £ 7 each student .
>>es<< 1 . the Museum is well - organised for tourists .
>>es<< there are some shops , café and toilets .
>>es<< also there are some free handphones , that explain the history of the museum .
>>es<< after their visit into the Museum , they could enjoy the superb view of the sea and the Tuscan Archipelago , and they could have a PIC - NIC on the beach .
>>es<< the negative aspect of the museum is that is quite expensive for students .
>>es<< although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students , I strongly reccomend it for their excursion and their interests .
>>es<< dear Mrs Maria Smith ,
>>es<< I am writing to give you some information asked in your letter , which I received this morning .
>>es<< your group has been booked in Palace Hotel which is one of the most comfortable hotels in London .
>>es<< it is based in the city centre and is about half an hour by underground from the conference .
>>es<< in my oppinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Picadelly line .
>>es<< however you would take bus number 150 , if you would like to have a look at the city centre and you have some free time also .
>>es<< regarding to the end - of - conference party , I would suggest to wear some dress for a woman and an elegant suit for a man , though , it is no formal do .

>>es<< Basicaly , during three hour time in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of interesting places of London .
>>es<< however you would have a long walk along the river to take some essential photos .
>>es<< are you always happy when your telephon ring ?
>>es<< as far as I am concerned the telephone was invented in 19th century .
>>es<< it has been affecting our lifes very quickly , although there were some different ways of communication as TV , for instance .
>>es<< since the internet was introduced , many of us would n &apos;t have imagined the lifes without this .
>>es<< we were able even to have our own telephone kept in our pocket for a some time .
>>es<< however , are you always happy when your personal phone rings .
>>es<< on the other hand I wonder whether you have experienced some situations when you would n &apos;t have your mobile switched on .
>>es<< this invention has affected my life completely .
>>es<< since I have been traveling around the world I would have imagined beeing in tough with my family or friends without internet or my mobile phone .

>>es<< the telephone : a great invention .
>>es<< yes , I know , it is just hard to imagine our lives without this invention .
>>es<< think about the people living in the time it was invented .
>>es<< must had been such a exciting thing being able to talk to someone living thousands of miles for ........ and now for us is just as simple as dial a number and talk to whoever we want to .
>>es<< of course is nice to have a phone conversation with friends or family , but the telephone is also very important for business and emergencies .
>>es<< for example , I work for a bank , and we need to have weekly meetings with our Director living 800 kilometers far , and he does n &apos;t have to come here , we just have a phone conference where everybody can talks , and that is it !
>>es<< a phone call in time for an ambulance can save the life of many people having a heart attack .

>>es<< but , anyway , people use cars .
>>es<< if we do n &apos;t use them we suffer from them .
>>es<< I really need it to escape from the pollution , mainly caused by cars and any other four - wheel motored vehicle .
>>es<< is n &apos;t that contradictorious ?
>>es<< to go to the countryside and being able to breath fresh , non - polluted air , I use my car , which , as far as I am concerned does not help to maintain a clean air at all .
>>es<< therefore I am thinking in selling my car , which has changed my life over the last 10 years , which has given me a kind of freedom , which has gone with me to all sort of fantastic places , and change my life for a new life : whithout car .
>>es<< I am writing in response to your letter in order to give you some further information about the international student conference in our college .
>>es<< I would like to inform you that your group has been booked into Palace Hotel .
>>es<< it is situated in the center of our town and it takes five minutes to get to the college , where the conference is going to be held .
>>es<< I think that the best choise for you is to take the 234 bus .
>>es<< the bus stop you should get off is called &quot; The Green Man &quot; .
>>es<< it is an evening dress for women and black trousers , a white shirt and a black bow tie for men .
>>es<< lastly , I would like to give you some suggestions about way in which you can spend your free time in our town .
>>es<< I am strongly convinced , that you should visit local Science Museum .
>>es<< also there is a very good shopping center next to the museum .
>>es<< I look forward to seeing your at the conference and hope that you will have a good time in our town .
>>es<< as it is widely known , lots of different and important things were invented during the 20th century , nevertheless I believe that the most important one is the computer .
>>es<< it is a fact , that the modern society have created the demand for the ability to cope with the vast amounts of information .
>>es<< taking it into consideration I would like to say that the computer is the priceless invention for an accountants , designers , engineers and so on and on .
>>es<< another point in favour is the possibility to connect to the Internet .
>>es<< it allows you to have all the necessary information &quot; on your fingertips &quot; .
>>es<< for instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with the virtual world , which computers create .
>>es<< another drawback is that in industry computers replace people &apos;s labour , which leads to the increasing of unemployment .
>>es<< to conclude I would like to say that the goverments of all developed countries would n &apos;t have been so concerned about so - called &quot; problem 2000 &quot; if the computer had not been so important for the modern society .
>>es<< dear Mrs Smith .
>>es<< it was very sorry news to Richard Brown .
>>es<< I have given much information of the international student conference .
>>es<< number 45 bus runs to there every 5 minutes .
>>es<< it takes 25 minutes that is convenient to us .
>>es<< secondly , there are some programme that are very great .
>>es<< first time , the conference &apos;s head make a short speech and then we have dinner and drinks .
>>es<< finally we enjoy a disco party so you wear a suiteable dress .
>>es<< on the last day I go to your house and then we think about our &apos;s conference plane .
>>es<< Alice and Jane came back her home .
>>es<< Alice is Jane &apos;s boy friend .
>>es<< in the morning they have met and then they went to beach .
>>es<< it was nice weather and beautiful time .
>>es<< Jane suddenly thought about her house key that left inside her house and Alice could see the her house and he found the bathroom window was opening .
>>es<< so he crimbed on the radder up to the window and he opened the door but policemen came there &quot; what happened ? &quot;
>>es<< Jane expained that situations and they under stood him .
>>es<< it was a very wonderful party and they have never forgot that day .
>>es<< dear Mrs Maria Smith :
>>es<< I am writting to give you the information that you asked me for .
>>es<< the group has been booked into the Harris hotel .
>>es<< this hotel is very good placed .
>>es<< from there you can get a taxi , catch the buses seven and eleven , wich both have you very close to the conference place , and also you can go by underground to get there .
>>es<< the conference starts at 5 : 30 pm and it finishes at 8 : 00PM .
>>es<< then , after the Conference , there will be a formal party at the group &apos;s hotel , wich starts at 9 : 00 PM and finishes at 12 : 00 AM .
>>es<< this party is a formal one , so you should be casual dressed .
>>es<< in this area you could visit the central park .
>>es<< I hope these information could be useful for you .
>>es<< yours Sincerelly
>>es<< Hampton Court palace is localizated in Hampton Court .
>>es<< in addition to that , I think this town is wonderful and it has a magical beauty .
>>es<< transport :
>>es<< to get to Hampton Court palace , you need to take a train from Waterloo train station .
>>es<< from there depart the trains to Hampton Court .
>>es<< moreover , I think by train is the best way to get there , because Hampton Court train station is very close to Hampton Court palace .
>>es<< there is a great price for children , students , adults and families .
>>es<< they are between three and six pounds each .
>>es<< and also it would be an excellent chance for this group of American students to see it .
>>es<< thank you for your letter , which arrived on second .
>>es<< I am very pleased to help to organize this Conference in our College , which will hold at Conference Centre at Bromley College starting on 20th June for 3 days .
>>es<< please find information your required as follows :
>>es<< called &quot; palace Hotel &quot; which is about 10 miles away from our College , the hotel will have a coach to pick the group up from the airport on 19th of June and then take the group to Conference and return to hotel every day .
>>es<< regarding to the end - of - conference party .
>>es<< we have planed a barbecue at 5 Oo pm. on our most idyllic play field which is over looking the endless Countryside and farms .
>>es<< at 7 : 00pm .
>>es<< on the last day , we have arranged a small party in the hotel , then we all set up to have a sightseeing Bromley town center for about two hours before you leave for airport .
>>es<< Bromley town center is the most beautiful shopping centre in South East London .
>>es<< there are many historical buildings remain .
>>es<< I think the students will enjoy this sightseeing .
>>es<< Yours. sincerely ,
>>es<< we need light every day , not just night time .
>>es<< we need lamp light in offices or schools or some places during the day time .
>>es<< how is the wonderful life after invention the light .
>>es<< here we just talk about the light we invented apart from nature light .
>>es<< when I was small , we lived in country yard , I remembered , we used to have oil lamps which used a cotton string dipping in the oil in the small bottle and made it burned the tip of the cotton string to give us light during the night time , it was very little light on , and many things we could n &apos;t do under the oil lamps because the light range was very small .
>>es<< there was no any light outside our house , no light on the road or field either .
>>es<< I was always very scared whenever or wherever. because most places .
>>es<< this scaring dark is still affecting my life now .
>>es<< I never stayed out after dark today except accompanying by my family .
>>es<< what a biggest person on the earth , who invented the light , Einstein was .
>>es<< he created another day time after sunset , people use it to do anything they want to do , We believe we ca n &apos;t live without light today , specially in city life , we have a long time to spend for the activities after Sun going to bed .
>>es<< which we definately need light to keep on . I dare to say , without light , our life will go into a dark , dark hell .
>>es<< I am writting you to reply your question about the conference in London. thank you for your letter .
>>es<< I am very pleasant to know you decided to come to the &quot; II International conference of Human Rights &quot; which will be celebrated in Albert Hall college next 25 of June .
>>es<< I would like to inform you that the group you belong to , has been booked in Palace Hotel , in the center of London from the 24 June until 25 of June .
>>es<< the Albert Hall College , the building where will be taken part the conference is sited near Green Park Avenue ; so , to get it from the Palace Hotel you can take the bus number 26 , otherwise , you can take the Picadilly Line from South Kensigton Station to green Park station .
>>es<< it takes about 10 minutes .
>>es<< therefore , that &apos;s the faster way of transport you can choose .
>>es<< the Conference will start at 9 am of 25 June and will finish about 6 pm in the same day .
>>es<< during the day is supposed having a break of half and hour at 12 p.m and finally , a party for all the people who will be there .
>>es<< that will be a smart party and because of this , it will be required a well - dressed and immaculate presence .
>>es<< ladies should wear an evening dress and gentlman a dark suit .
>>es<< as I can see from your letter , you will have about three hours before you catch your plane , so , I would suggest to visit The Tate Modern Museum , where you will can find several interesting pictures such as Dali &apos;s Warhols .
>>es<< if you need some more information or details about he conference , you can contact Alexia on 0033 * * * phone .
>>es<< the aim of this report is giving some suggestions to a group of American students who has just arrived in Rome and want some information about an interesting building to visit .
>>es<< Rome is a big city where they can find several moments and important buildings , for this reason I would suggest them to visit
>>es<< 1 ) &quot; Fontana di Trevi &quot; sited in Trevis Square in the center of Rome .
>>es<< that &apos;s a small square where there is a fountain very big .
>>es<< it was built by Canovas architect in 1638 .
>>es<< that is the fountain which &quot; dolce vita &quot; film was taken place .
>>es<< 2 ) For other hand , there is Villa Borghese Building , That is a museum where they can find the most important sculptures and pictures of Antonio Canovas and , Bernini , who stayed for a long time working in Rome .
>>es<< I would recommend them the buildings because :
>>es<< 1 ) First of all , there are sited in the center of Rome so , they can take a bus to get them move and around the city .
>>es<< 2 ) Secondly , they can enjoy visiting museums , and afterwards they can take something to eat or to drink in the &quot; pizzerias &apos; and restaurants near these famous places .
>>es<< in conclusion , they could combine art , the history and the night visiting one only place without spend much money .
>>es<< as our conference is due to start next week I respond straight away .
>>es<< there are some Informations you have asked me about .
>>es<< that is the best option because it is placed less than 5 minutes walk from the Conference Center .
>>es<< when you live a hotel you have to turn right and you bloun the street .
>>es<< that &apos;s our Conference Center .
>>es<< at the hotel reception you will find printed information how to get over there .
>>es<< as you know at the end - of - conference there is a party .
>>es<< Party is due to start at 8 p.m until 3 a.m. There is 2hr break between end - of - conference and party .
>>es<< at this time you and your group can refresh yourself .
>>es<< hope you will enjoy it .
>>es<< we prepared some special attraction like live dance music and hot or cold buffet .
>>es<< about you &apos;re the last question I can sugest to visit the Royal Castle .
>>es<< your sincerely ,
>>es<< in our town there is so many interesting places to see that there is hard to choose one .
>>es<< in my opinion the most interesting is the Castle .
>>es<< it is placed on a hill so it is very easy to recognize when is it .
>>es<< actually it is a whole complex , the Old and the New Castle , Cathedrall and the most interesting undergroud part with it &apos;s amazing crypts .
>>es<< and if you climb on the top of the main tower - the keep you will see unforgetable view on a white toun .
>>es<< you will find there an amazing collection of old weapon , armores and , we are especially pround of it , the great collection of swords .
>>es<< after that I am sure you will be happy to find a few restaurands located at the New Castle .
>>es<< I am sure that should be enought for one day trip .
>>es<< for you information I can say that at this time we have five weeks festival and this night there will be a great display .
>>es<< that should complete that amazing day .
>>es<< I do welcome you and your group , and I am willing to help you by giving the Informations that you have asked me .
>>es<< firstly , let me explain the way from the palace hotel , where your group will be staying , to the conference .
>>es<< the hotel is located in the centre of Seoul , therefore there many ways to get to the conference .
>>es<< finally , I would like you to recommend the visit to a traditional Korean palace Kyong Bok for the last day &apos;s free time .
>>es<< it must be a very interesting visit for the students who has never experienced an oriental atmosphere .
>>es<< this report provides the information about Kyong Bok Palace , which is highly recommended to visit for visitors from foreign countries .
>>es<< it highlights the background history and considers the interest of young peoples , and makes a final recommendation .
>>es<< the kingdom Chosun has a history for 500 years and lasted until the beginning of 20th century .
>>es<< as the kings of Chosun loved to be a part of the nature , the palace had a huge garden , however it was destroyed by the army of Japan , and now there remains only a part of the original palace .
>>es<< there is a special monument for the last queen of Chosun who was killed by the Japanese army .
>>es<< the reason that this palace is also popular for the youngsters , who tends to dislike the historical visit , would be the various activity .
>>es<< also there are performances which helds daily in the front gate of the palace .
>>es<< it is out of question not to visit Kyong Bok Palace unless you do not want to know about Korean history .
>>es<< I am writing in response to your letter where you asked me to give you more information about international student conference and give some ideas and suggestions of what you and your students can do during your free time here .
>>es<< the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is located in the central area of the city , so it will not take you and your students too much time to get to the town hall where the conference is supposed to be progressed .
>>es<< the easiest way to get there from your hotel is to take buses 461 or 176 ( the bus stop is opposite to the hotel ) or we can hire a minibus for you but there is an extra charge for it .
>>es<< less of the party is likely to be as our night club so a lots of music , dancing and fun are provided .
>>es<< please note that the alchocholich drinks are only sold untill 11 pm .
>>es<< coming back to ideas and suggestions I &apos;v promised to give you about free afternoon befor you catch your plane I can advise you to visit our zoo or to for a picnik in a park befor you will go to the night party .
>>es<< such a simple and usuall things like a telefone , a car , a computer so only seem to be normal and usuall for us ( or we have got used ) as we use them every day .
>>es<< hundred years before people could n &apos;t even use an electric lump not saying about a car or computer .
>>es<< they have intentions improved our life a lot since they had appeared , but not every one beleives it is really so .
>>es<< some people say that many of important inventions in our live are not so good and useful as we have got used to see them .
>>es<< first of all they say about enviroment pollution which cars and other vechicles make , overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some others .
>>es<< but to my opinion if peoples inventions take a place in our lifes they are right then .
>>es<< I think the telefone is the most important thing in many people &apos;s lifes as it makes you to be able to get in touch with anyone does n &apos;t matter wherever you are ( I am talking about mobile phones which now have a majority of our choice ) .
>>es<< an electric lamp was an important invention hundred years before ( but for that time it was like a revolution ) .
>>es<< I think it would n &apos;t be possible to survive for us without an eclectric life .
>>es<< because of shipbuilding development people could make all the geographical discoveries , and an automobile transport is undenyable neccecerity in our life .
>>es<< in case of all said I am more likely to think that the benefits of advantages of peopel &apos;s inventions are much higre the all their disadvantages .
>>es<< I have just read your letter and I am happy to help with giving you some further information .
>>es<< according to your first question , for the time of conference the students will be staying at the Palace Hotel , where the reservation has been already made .
>>es<< it is situated near to our college , about five minutes walk from the nearest tube station , which is South Wimbledon .
>>es<< as you were informed , there will be a party for all attendants of the conference , which will take place afterwards at the hotel restaurant .
>>es<< minding the fact that it will be entirely sociable meeting I believe that casual clothes are the most suitable option for this event .
>>es<< finally , answering your last question about student &apos;s day - out , I suggest visiting a local lawn tennis museums and Wimbledon Tennis Courts as it is one of the best international tourists attractions .
>>es<< if you have any further questione , please do not hesitate to contact me .
>>es<< subject : Recomnendations of a place to visit
>>es<< the aim of this report is to give description and recommendation of the most interesting building in the town .
>>es<< the place I would like to recommend is the seventienth - century Royal Palace .
>>es<< it is situated in a heart of Warsaw and surrounded by the buildings of an Old Town .
>>es<< there is a square old Market with the magnificent statue of the King Zygmunt , in the centre of it .
>>es<< inside the Palace , there is a museum of an antique collection of porcalaine .
>>es<< the Old Town is the best place for afternoon stroll with a great deal of restaurants , caffes and street performers .
>>es<< there is an easy reach to cashpoints , lavatories , emergency services , etc .
>>es<< it is easy to get there by any sort of public transport
>>es<< there are numbers of hotels or youth hostels to stay overninight , if necessary
>>es<< most of the admissions are absolutely free .
>>es<< a part of the Palace might be closed , due to the constant renovations .
>>es<< all the facilities are usually overcrowded during a summer holiday .

>>es<< I am writing to give you some advice of an international student conference .
>>es<< first of all , the name of hotel which we have been booked into is Palace Hotel .
>>es<< and we have two choices to get to the conference , a bus or a train .
>>es<< the day before we will leave there , we have a party which takes place in our hotel .
>>es<< it is a kind of formal party , so we should be well - dressed .
>>es<< I suggest that you wear a formal dress .
>>es<< there is some finger foods and drinks .
>>es<< it might be a great party for end of conference .
>>es<< end of all , in my opinion we could go a center of the town because there is many places to have a look and go shopping .
>>es<< it &apos;s quite a nice and a suitable place to spend for three hours .
>>es<< if a telephone haven &apos;t been invented , we would n &apos;t have lived perfectly like nowadays .
>>es<< would n &apos;t you think we rely on it more than we expect ?
>>es<< a telephone is used when we need to contact with someone , and also an emergency situation and an internet .
>>es<< it has various way to use , however , nowadays it is not only used by these purpose , but also it keeps our company .
>>es<< even if you feel alone , you can talk and hear from your friend easily .
>>es<< long time ago people lived without this perfect invention .
>>es<< they used to keep in touch with someone with a letter .
>>es<< in spite of taking a lot of time to catch up with , it was a only way .
>>es<< so that &apos;s why they have invented a telephon .
>>es<< now we could feel the world closer and closer beaus of a telephone .
>>es<< who would n &apos;t thank for this great invention ?
>>es<< I received your letter and I &apos;m pleased to answer your questions .
>>es<< this is a first class hotel .
>>es<< the easiest way from the hotel to the conference is with the bus .
>>es<< take the bus in direction center town .
>>es<< after four stops get off the bus .
>>es<< if you leave the bus , the conference is in the house opposite the road .
>>es<< afterwards we will eat together in a restaurant and we will go in a disco .
>>es<< for the disco you musn &apos;t wear blue jeans .
>>es<< finally at your last day I propose you to do a sightseeing tour in our town .
>>es<< afterwards you will have any time to buy some souvenirs from Switzerland .
>>es<< if you have any more questions , write me back .
>>es<< yours sincerely ,
>>es<< with the computer our work is easier and more interesting .
>>es<< before the time with computers , people had to write every time a whole letter .
>>es<< when they would correct a word , they had to write the whole letter again .
>>es<< with the computer we can write a letter , correct a word or change the name without writting the whole letter again . we save the letter and in three week we could send it to another person .
>>es<< I work at a bank and I work all day with computers .
>>es<< if we hand &apos;t Ay one , we had to write all the transactions on papers .
>>es<< if I order money for our bank with the computer I can be sure that I will arrive the day after .
>>es<< but if I had to write a letter and to send it by post , the money will arrive two or three days after .
>>es<< I have never work without a computer , but if we had n &apos;t any we would it find normally .
>>es<< Mrs Maria Smith ,
>>es<< I &apos;m pleased to be able to help you for the international student conference .
>>es<< the hotel in which the group has been booked to is the Palace hotel , which is situated near the big bridge of Mont Blanc .
>>es<< to get from the hotel to the conference , you have to take the highway indirection of Lausanne , and after nearly half an hour of driving you come out at the place which is indicated with Coppet , Divonne .
>>es<< when you come out , just go on your right , and then turn left to follow the indications to the Châtaigneroie school .
>>es<< you should wear some formal clothes , but not necessary really pretty clothes
>>es<< I hope that these Informations will help you
>>es<< the portable phone , a very useful invention !
>>es<< during all mankind history , there were discovers who tried to make human life better , but it is in the last century that there were the most biggest discoveries made .
>>es<< when the phone without cable was invented , one was n &apos;t sure if it would be a success or not .
>>es<< but the research went on , and the portable phone is getting always smaller and more useful .
>>es<< the portable phone is an important invention , because nearly everybody has one , and so one can always call somebody if there is a problem .
>>es<< moreover , some portable phones have a connection to the web , so it is easy to read newspapers if one hasn &apos;t enough money to buy it .
>>es<< personally , the portable phone has affected my own life , because when somebody is phoning at home , I do n &apos;t have to rush to take the phone , being afraid that it &apos;s too late .
>>es<< I recommend this extremely important invention to those who still do n &apos;t have a portable phone .
>>es<< I would be pleased to help you about all your questions and I will provide you some information which you need as much as I can .
>>es<< I would like to inform you that Centeral Red Lion Hotel has been booked for the accomadation of the group and it will be quite easy to get every where from the hotel on foot during your stay .
>>es<< as you know that we arrange an evening party on the third day of the week , we can say that a kind of relaxation time .
>>es<< place is College garden .
>>es<< time is 7 pm .
>>es<< there is no need to bother about clouths .
>>es<< everybody can put on something casual .
>>es<< Befor leav from England I suggest you to visit the cannals and small villages around Basingstoke . you could find the opportunaty to see the country life .
>>es<< I have to admit that whoever invented the cars and transportation vehicles did the most respectable invention of the word .
>>es<< I say that it must be the most important thing for us because they save our times passing so fast .
>>es<< can you deny how quickly we get somewhere by car or by bus .
>>es<< may be 10 times as quick as getting somewhere on foot .
>>es<< try to imagine your life without having anyof them .
>>es<< would n &apos;t be unbarable and painful .
>>es<< Ceartainly it would be just like mine .
>>es<< because I live in a rural area far from any village , town , or city center .
>>es<< the nearest civilization takes me 1 hour on foot .
>>es<< I have no car , no local bus service to use .
>>es<< even comeing to Basingstoke seems like a international journey to me .
>>es<< and ofcause this stops me everytime to live sociable life .
>>es<< but also I &apos;m aware of that the time flies for me . I must do whatever I want befor it is too late .
>>es<< and I have to confess the invention of the car was the most usefull invention for the humanity .
>>es<< I was delighted to receive your letter and to know that a group of students from your college have decided to take a part in our international student conference .
>>es<< as you need more information , I answer all your questions with plesuare .
>>es<< it is one of the most comfortable hotels in our sity and situated only half a mile from main building of our college , so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot .
>>es<< secondly , our end - of - conference party is included dinner and dancing , I would advise you to wear something not very formal .
>>es<< finally , you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historical places ( castles , builded in 13-th century ) or art gallery , as well as beatiful Bodnant garden .
>>es<< I am looking forward to the meeting with you and mutual work during conference .
>>es<< your sincerely
>>es<< we are so used to them , that sometimes think they existed always .
>>es<< some of them are very practical , other are rather strange .
>>es<< I thing , that one of the most importent and affecting our life inventions is the telephone .
>>es<< imagine life without phone .
>>es<< you are on the road , you have car accident .
>>es<< what are you going to do without phone ?
>>es<< on another situation , your son is ill , he needs help urgently .
>>es<< I am sure , the phone has saved many lifes .
>>es<< besides , it is always very nice to ring your friend or mum , only for chating in any time .
>>es<< thanks the phone , it is possible even your Mam is on the other end of the Earth .
>>es<< to be honest , next great invention of people , computer , ca n &apos;t work , if you haven &apos;t got the phone .
>>es<< so I am very grateful to man , who invented it , unfornutely , I have forgotten his name .
>>es<< it always happens with people , does n &apos;t ?
>>es<< try to ask who invented the will or the book .
>>es<< it is with great regret that I hear of Mr Brown &apos;s illness , and hope to see him soon in an excellent health .
>>es<< furthermore , since it is located between the airport and our location , a bus shuttle has been organised to pick all our guests from the hotel to the conference room .
>>es<< the end - of - conference party is to be held at the &apos; Royal Room &apos; of the hotel , which has an outstanding reputation for its quality and seriousness .
>>es<< therefore , all guests will be asked to wear the corresponding clothes in order to be accepted .
>>es<< as for the three hours of free time , I strongly suggest you to check - in your lugages at the airport and then , after a five - minutes bus ride , spend your time in the marvellous &apos; Old City &apos; .
>>es<< the technological revolution taking place today can be directly linked to the amazing evolution of our communication abilities throughout those last years .
>>es<< the inevitable invention symbolizing this aspect in our ordinary life is , of course , the mobile phone .
>>es<< it is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has becomed a necessary condition in some professional activities .
>>es<< however , the common man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes , when in the hands of a high - school student .
>>es<< it becomes then a real obsession for the average students , as e uses it before the lessons , during the lessons , during lunch and , especially , during examinations ...
>>es<< nevertheless , it is also a common mistake to believe that the sole purpose of such an usage is to communicate information during an exam , since its major role is actually to allow the student and the parents to discuss during everyday &apos;s courses .
>>es<< bottom line is that any teacher complaining about this situation should confiscate not the student &apos;s phone , but his parents &apos; !
>>es<< I have just received the letter from you and I &apos;m writting to you as soon as posible .
>>es<< I can promise to you that I &apos;ll do my best to help you .
>>es<< poor Mr. Brown , I hope he will get better soon .
>>es<< as I &apos;ve just checked the group has been booked into The Palace Hotel .
>>es<< the best way to get from there to the conference is by coache , that I have arranged for you .
>>es<< the driver Mr. Olsson works for us since .
>>es<< he will pick you up at 11 Oo a.m. The conference is from 12 Oo to 2 Oo p.m. At the end of conference is a party from 2 Oo to 3 Oo .
>>es<< I suggest you to wear comfortable and nice clothes because I have planed a sightseeing for you before your plane at 8 Oo p.m. I &apos;d like to show you a museum , a gallery and the gardens that are belonging to the palace .
>>es<< then we can have a rest in the caffee and talk before your flight home .
>>es<< I think I gave you all importen Informations .
>>es<< I hope to see you all soon ,
>>es<< Nowdays motorization is one of the most important inventions .
>>es<< as you look amoung everybody has a car or motorcycle .
>>es<< let me to tell you , how invention of motorcycle has affected my life .
>>es<< I love motocycles and I do n &apos;t think I could live without them .
>>es<< I drive motocycle since I was 16 year old .
>>es<< me and my brother we used to go to the rock concerts .
>>es<< we have met a lot of people there same mad about motorcycle as we were .
>>es<< we were avenging races and trips .
>>es<< we were driving motocycles few day befour we finally had got to mitting points .
>>es<< I really enjoy driving motocycle .
>>es<< people say that is dangerous , I do n &apos;t think so .
>>es<< when I drive is only me and my motocycle .
>>es<< before me and after are my friends that I like and trust .
>>es<< and around me nature that I can watch and enjoy while we shop fore camp .
>>es<< we can go to any place we like , avoid traffic and to full buses , trains , etc .
>>es<< I am really greatful for people who invented the first motocycle in the world .
>>es<< I feel very bad about that I do n &apos;t know who was it .
>>es<< on the other hand no matter that I feel very good about that because that invention has changed and affected my life end people I care about , has affected my life in a very best way .
>>es<< as you asked me in the letter , I am very happy to help you with finding out details of the conference .
>>es<< the hotel that your group will be staying at is Palace Hotel .
>>es<< it is reasonably near to the college , so it may be very good to walk from the hotel along River Thames following yellow signs on sunny days .
>>es<< if it rains , you can take bus 54 that stops in front of the college .
>>es<< the end - of - conference party is designed to give rough ideas about many different cultures .
>>es<< as a part of this , the leader of each group has to wear a costume of her country .
>>es<< other members of groups can wear a normal pretty formal dress .
>>es<< on the last day , I recommend that you will visit the place that is located at the centre of our city .
>>es<< well , I am sure that you can hardly do this unless you are living deep in a forest or in a dessert !
>>es<< if you think about how many computers we use every day and how dependent we are on them , it must be clear that invention of computers has certainly had a significant impact on all our lives .
>>es<< for example , all infrastructures such as transports and power stations are ran using computers government uses them to organise all sorts of things in a country , and all kids of services and businesses such as hospitals and supermarkets use them as essential capitals .
>>es<< it improves productivity of my homework , that is often essay writing , and also it allows me to access to the internet .
>>es<< since I live abroad , the internet is really useful for me to have a contact with my bestfriend and to know what is going on in my home country .
>>es<< to sum up , I can say that the greatest ever invention is the invention of computers that has affected both indivisuals and a society as a whole .
>>es<< I am writing in reply to your enquiry about this year international conference .
>>es<< there will be signs to follow from Central train station .
>>es<< the conference is commensing on 31st June 2001 from 10.00 - 15.00 .
>>es<< light lunch will be provided .
>>es<< there is no dressed - code for the party .
>>es<< however I suggest you could wear the same outfit as you wear for the conference .
>>es<< I have included the local map , there are some ideas at the back of the map .
>>es<< please let me know if you would like to book one of the city - walk tours , We have arrange spacial discounts for the conference attendance .
>>es<< Personly I recommend the Dicken &apos;s tour because it is a good length of walking and very historical .
>>es<< I hope that I have covered all information you would need and look forward to seeing you .
>>es<< your sincerely ,
>>es<< P.S. Please find the enclosed map .
>>es<< I believe Liverpool Street Station is at the top list .
>>es<< despite the fact that this building has served half - a million commuters in a day , it always clean and functional .
>>es<< there are two parts of Liverpool Street Station that make it so interesting building .
>>es<< the newly decorated section is fairly modern style with escalators and touched - screen ticket machine .
>>es<< it is also very well linked into the old underground station which it is such a contrast in transformation .
>>es<< you could really imagine how it looked like in the old day .
>>es<< at the far back of the station is also connected to a spacious well designed pedestrians park .
>>es<< it is a good example of a great architecture that was designed to provide services to the public .
>>es<< finally , it is in the heart of city and everyone would be able to find without doubt .
>>es<< so the conference will be a great experience to you and your group .
>>es<< a free shuttel - bus gets you to the conference - center .
>>es<< the bus leavs at 8 a.m. at the front entrance of the hotel .
>>es<< the end - of - conference party is playing in a rent and in the greenground .
>>es<< there will be a barbecue , a place to dance and many more .
>>es<< it is a surprice !

>>es<< the last afternoon you could go on a city - tour , visite the museum of Fine Arts or enjoy the beautiful flower garden next to the common park .
>>es<< I hope I could give you some ideas . I look forward to seeing you .
>>es<< have you ever thought about a world without phone ?
>>es<< how was it in the 18 century with no opportunity to communicate by phone and how would it be now ?
>>es<< we are living in a busy world .
>>es<< in the business world you use the phone all the time to speak with your clients , to make appointments , to order an article e.c. ; then , time is money !
>>es<< how has the phone affected my own life ? I think , that is a good question to think about . I could not call my friends from an other city and just say &quot; hello &quot; .
>>es<< it would be difficult and take more time to make an appointment .
>>es<< so , what did the phone - revolution for us ?
>>es<< it saves time .
>>es<< I thank you for your recent letter .
>>es<< first , I would like to congratulate on your new responsability , because of Mr Brown &apos;s illness .
>>es<< I give you with great pleasure all the details needed .
>>es<< your group is staying at the Palace Hotel , which is located directly in front of the bus station .
>>es<< you have to take the bus number 1 and get off at &quot; Black House &quot; , which is the third stop .
>>es<< after the conference , at about 8 pm. a party is organised .
>>es<< during it , everybody will have the opportunity to met and talk to the speakers of the conference .
>>es<< after the cocktail , the Band &quot; Zero one &quot; is playing their famous songs .

>>es<< I hope you will enjoy your journey in our city and look forward to meeting you at this conference .
>>es<< yours faithfully ,
>>es<< there , I saw the exibitions and admired the building itself .
>>es<< the museum is located in Ouchy , in front of the &quot; Delamuraz Hotel &quot; .
>>es<< it is close to the main road , and at 300 meters of the station .
>>es<< before going inside , you have to pas through the huge garden .
>>es<< I recommend you to take your swim suit , because in summer , it is allowed to swim in pools .
>>es<< there were all painting during the war by nurses .
>>es<< if you go down a few steps , you will discover the ceilar .
>>es<< everything in this room is about wine .
>>es<< the only negative point is that you have to pay 10 francs to visit. the house and the garden .
>>es<< actually , the college is situated 500 meters away from the Hotel .
>>es<< it will begin at 7 p.m and last until late in the evening .
>>es<< in fact , the purpose of the end - of - conference party is to relax after a busy day , therefore you and your students can put jeans and sport shoes on .
>>es<< I hope the international student conference will help to know each other better and that it will be a success .
>>es<< I &apos;m writing in reply to your letter in which you asked me information on an interesting building to visit .
>>es<< there is so many places of interest in Lausanne , but I think that the Olympic Museum is the most notable for the following reasons :
>>es<< you can see the evolution of sports and understand why changes gradually have been done to improve them .
>>es<< you can admire every kind of equipments you need to do any particular sport .
>>es<< you will be informed about the story of sport in general and about the new technologies which are used nowaday n high competitions .
>>es<< the museum is near the city center and is accessible by bus or walking .
>>es<< it will takes you an afternoon to visit it and then you can enjoy a drink or a meal in the restaurant on the third floor , well - known for being one of the best establishment in Lausanne .
>>es<< first of all , your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , Main - Road 21 , which is situated not far from our college .
>>es<< I &apos;d suggest you to walk , it will only take you about seven minutes .
>>es<< just follow Main - Road until to reach a junction , where you turn right and then walk along Denl - a - Lion Road .
>>es<< secondly , you have required information about the end - of - conference party .
>>es<< there is no need putting on special clothes for the party , casual ones should do it as well , for we want everyone to feel comfortable .
>>es<< last but not least I will give you some ideas of where to spend your free afternoon .
>>es<< I &apos;d suggest you to visit our local museum , as there is a marvellous exhibition there at the moment .
>>es<< provided the weather is fine , you could also go swimming or make a tour through our beautiful town .
>>es<< ( I could book a guide for you if you &apos;re interested )
>>es<< not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment ?
>>es<< when Alexander Graham bell first invented the telephone , he had no idea of how popular it would be one day .
>>es<< its first appliance was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person .
>>es<< nowadays , however , the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it .
>>es<< please transmit him my best wishes for his recovery .
>>es<< it is a very cosy building that is on the same avenue as the conference building , approximetively one mile away .
>>es<< there is a direct bus link between the two locations : this is bus line number six ; the bus station for the conference building is called &quot; Avenue de Cour &quot; and the one at the Palace Hotel is named &quot; Main station &quot; .
>>es<< concerning the party we do not have a casual dressing code .
>>es<< students usually wear dark clothes with a tie for the boys and a mid - long skirt or dress for the girls .
>>es<< I would like to suggest visiting the &quot; ethnographic Museum , , which is kind of unique in the world .
>>es<< I remain , yours sincerely .
>>es<< I think that the car is one of the human inventions that has the most affected the way of life of people from industrial countries .
>>es<< nowadays more than the percents of the world industry is related to the automotive business : car manufacturing , gasoline extracting and refining , tyres recycling , and so on .
>>es<< the industrial countries have encountered deep evolution of their strictures since the car has been made available to everyone .
>>es<< at the beginning of the last Century only a few very rich people could afford a car ; it was kind of leisure or sport to drive one .
>>es<< the transport network has changed according to this social evolution .
>>es<< the increasing number of cars related and infrastructure are now creeting problems .
>>es<< a lot of roads and motorways are overcrowded , and enviromment issues are more and more related to the intensive use of cars and lorries .
>>es<< people and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the enviromment without impacting their mobility .
>>es<< my name is juniper , I am helping to organise the conference in the college .
>>es<< the group has been booked into Palace Hotel which is not very far from the place where the conference will be held .
>>es<< you can take the No.41 bus from the hotel to the conference , it only takes ten minutes approximately .
>>es<< as for the end - of - conference party , it will be on the morning of the last day starting at 9 : 00 .
>>es<< all the students and staffs will join together in the hall .
>>es<< they can play games and talk about personal experience .
>>es<< the main aim of it is to deepen the friendship among all these pupils coming from all over the world .
>>es<< so it would be fine if you wear casual clothes and look smart .
>>es<< I have made arrangement for the afternoon on the last day for you .
>>es<< if you are free I will show you arround our college .
>>es<< you can visit our newly - built science lab as well .
>>es<< you asked me for an interesting building to visit .
>>es<< in my opinion , I &apos;ll recommend British Museum .
>>es<< the museum looks very old as some other buildings in London , but it is very modern inside .
>>es<< after going through the enormous main door , you can see a huge white round building which is a library .
>>es<< a lot of famous people have been to this library before !
>>es<< almost each one tells you a story or gives you a picture about British history .
>>es<< apart from the national history , there are more content about the past of the world .
>>es<< you can go to many sections such as Asia Hall , Egypt Hall , Europe Hall and so on .
>>es<< countless fascinating things will definely take you the whole day to appreciate .
>>es<< after a visit to British Museum , you will be certainly able to put your history textbook away !
>>es<< also you do n &apos;t have to pay any money for it , and the transport is extremely convenient , therefore British Museum is your best choice . do n &apos;t be hesitant any more !
>>es<< dear Mrs Smith .
>>es<< the hotel your group has been booked into is called Palace Hotel .
>>es<< it is simple to find the way from this hotel to the conference .
>>es<< there you will find a modern building with two different doors a red and a blue one .
>>es<< you are asked to take the blue door .
>>es<< after entering you will see the signed conference room .
>>es<< we organized a end - of - conference party on the day before your departure .
>>es<< everyone is welcome to join this party to get to know each other in a good atmosphere .
>>es<< you should wear nice and comfortable cloth .
>>es<< I suggest you visiting the old part of Zurich or going to the zoo before your departure .
>>es<< if there is any question left , please contact me .
>>es<< I love baking cakes , cockies and breads .
>>es<< baking is passion and in the town I live I &apos;m known for making the best cakes in the area .
>>es<< it does n &apos;t matter in what kind of mood I am , I can do it all the time and it makes me feel good .
>>es<< if there is someone who does n &apos;t agree with me , he or she should try to live one month without using the oven .
>>es<< besides that he or she should look carefully into what he or she buys .
>>es<< I &apos;m positive that after such an experience everyone says that the oven is a really important invention for our lifes .
>>es<< I &apos;m thanking the person who invented the oven .
>>es<< and I understand that you need help , so that I will help you as far as I can .
>>es<< firstly , the hotel which ha been booked for you is Palace Hotel that is located close to the conference .
>>es<< in order to get from the hotel to the conference , you just need to take the bus we will offer .
>>es<< finally , if you want to have an exciting experience in here , I strongly suggest that you go to the musicals .
>>es<< as you may hear , our city is well known for the musicals .
>>es<< or , If you want to relax , you can take a walk in the park situated in ten minutes distance on foot from the hotel .
>>es<< if you have more questions about the conference and something else , do not hesitate to ask me . I would be glad to be able to help you .
>>es<< some inventions are not regarded as great things even though the life without them can not be imagined .
>>es<< however , there is something which is still believed that it was an extreamly important invention .
>>es<< this is electricity invented by Edison .
>>es<< from my point of view , the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most of machines , appliances and equipments which are used in modern times can be operated with only electricity , which makes people not to too much phisical labour .
>>es<< at night , I can study because of it. and also It saves my time which would be used up for doing housework such as laundry , cleaning rooms and ironing .
>>es<< it makes my life more convenient than that without it .
>>es<< Dar Mrs. Maria Smith ,
>>es<< I am very glad to help you about the International Student Conference .
>>es<< I hope that our friend Richard Brown does n &apos;t have any serious willness .
>>es<< referent , where is the conference .

>>es<< we could chouse two options for spending our free time .
>>es<< one is a guide tour on center city , and another is visiting the chocolate factory .
>>es<< please , if you have any more question , please call me at 38755980 .
>>es<< when we are using different equipments in our houses , we are using the electricity .
>>es<< I do n &apos;t like tinking , my house of my life , without all this facilities .
>>es<< what I can do without my music and my computer .
>>es<< now , just you need to think that you would do or what would happen in a city , with a car , aeroplans , shoops , all these things without lights .
>>es<< finally . I think that everybody know that the electricity is very important invent and for me it is the best .
>>es<< thanks for your last letter and I am sorry for not giving you enough information .
>>es<< we have already booked a 4 stars hotel - Palace Hotel , which is near the River Thames , in Walton - on - Thames .
>>es<< the end - of - conference party will be held in an India restaurant , that is next to the hotel .

>>es<< nowadays , our lives is becoming better and better .
>>es<< lots of great inventions has been invented in order to make people live comfortablely .
>>es<< &quot; televisions is just an amazing invention . &quot; my good friend said that . I agree with her .
>>es<< firstly , televisions make us know more about the world without travel it all .
>>es<< if there are no televisions , we Wo n &apos;t know what are the other countries like , or even what language they speak unless we go to that country .
>>es<< secondly , for some points , it can educate young children .
>>es<< many TV programmes are especially made for children , such as &quot; Learn follow me &quot; and &quot; Be good to others &quot; .
>>es<< actually , they are quite good programmes and helped me know what I should do generally or how to behave nicely when I was still a child .
>>es<< the last but not least , it is a good kind of entertainments .
>>es<< maybe you will think that playing basketball , going to cinemas and discos are much better that staying at home sitting in front of an object .
>>es<< if sometimes I do n &apos;t want to go out and I do n &apos;t want to be lonely , that &apos;s easy , just turn on the television and enjoy myself .

>>es<< I think its important to see it when you come there because it shows us how the town had been developped around it since its creation .
>>es<< those days , the castle is being remade , so there is a lot of construction engines around it .
>>es<< that &apos;s not a big problem because there is a complete museum in it where you can see old pictures of the castle during the centuries .
>>es<< there is a lot of old items that were in the King &apos;s family .
>>es<< you should have probably heard about the mummy who sleeps there for about two thousand years ... You can see it in the dungeon .
>>es<< I hope you will enjoy the visit and I wish you a nice holliday in Yverdon .
>>es<< first of all , we have already booked the Five - Stars Hotel for your group .
>>es<< it is a modern hotel , near our college , and it is also very convenent to come from the airport . you can take both by buses or taxies .
>>es<< the nember 101 bus starts from the airport , than you can get off from &quot; city college &quot; stop .
>>es<< it would be a great chance to tark part in the party for everyone .
>>es<< this is just a relaxing party , just for the members have a chance to relax and make friends .
>>es<< so I think you &apos;d better to wear a dress .
>>es<< finally , about the free three hours , my personal prefer to go shopping .
>>es<< our city has got the biggest shoping centre in South England , there gathers so many shops .
>>es<< it worthes tp spend time and money on that .
>>es<< Nowdays people have become used to watching televesion &apos;s programs everyday .
>>es<< the TV is so important that you can see it in every family , and it is a essential equipment for everyone .
>>es<< first of al , in my opinion , TV has a great education functions , and also makes the world become small .
>>es<< you can just sit at home then you can know what is happening all over the world at the moment .
>>es<< I would rather watching the news on TV in stead of reading in newspaper or hearing on radio because the news on TV are vivid .
>>es<< moreover , the TV is a great company for the people who live alone or feel alone . I would like to open TV when I stay at home .
>>es<< someone are talking , laughting , crying on there , so join them , you will feel much better than just yourself .
>>es<< some TV programs are enjouable !
>>es<< you might just sitting in front of TV for hours learn nothing , or no more talk with your family .
>>es<< I think this is the badest influence in the society .
>>es<< in clucsion , the TV has both advantages and disagvangtages , but on the whole advantages is greater than disadvantages .
>>es<< so , but on the whole , TV still is a wonderful and important invention on the world .
>>es<< I am writing to you to give you more Informations about an international student conference .
>>es<< the group has been booked into King Hotel at High Street which is very easy to find .
>>es<< and the best way to get from there to the conference is following the rod in front of the hotel to the right , then cross the zebra crossing to the opposite side .
>>es<< after that walk to the right about 15 metres and you will find the conference place which is called White House .
>>es<< at the end of conference , we are going to have an International Dinner as well as some shows from the students in my college .
>>es<< as this is a special conference so you could wear your own national dress to present your country .
>>es<< finally , on the last day you could spend your free time to visit our town hall which you will be able to learn more about my area - or do some shopping at High Street .
>>es<< I am writing to give an information on a very interesting building to visit .
>>es<< it is called Penrhyh Castle , as the building will tell you all about Wales .
>>es<< on the positive side , you and the group will be Abe to learn more about Welsh art works which are presented on the wall , on the door and some furnitures .
>>es<< and some old toilets might look awlful .
>>es<< but in my recommendation , I think it would be nice for the students to come and see this building .
>>es<< because they will be able to learn and compare with the place in their country .
>>es<< as Wales is not modern like America , so the students will probably get the idea of looking back to the old things .
>>es<< dear Mrs Maria Smith .
>>es<< I was really pleased to receive at your letter .
>>es<< so , I &apos;m writting to reply for giving all the information you asked for .
>>es<< the best way to get from the hotel to the conference its using tube because it takes only 20 mininute .
>>es<< the tube is 2 line which is red colour .
>>es<< and your speach would be better for the end of conference party .
>>es<< I &apos;d suggest you to wear at least , semi formal wears such as a jacket with another clothes .
>>es<< computer is the most important invention in our life .
>>es<< some people might say the electricity more important than another thingh .
>>es<< however , I &apos;d say computer is more amazing invention rather than another inventions such as the telephone , the car .
>>es<< recently computer is really necessary and we ca n &apos;t manage to work without them .
>>es<< not only is for bussiness , but also in for my life .
>>es<< for instance , when I want to contanct with to my friend , it &apos;s quite helpful by using e - mail .
>>es<< before computer had been invented , we could n &apos;t possibly have lots of information easily and we could n &apos;t contact with to foreign countries at the same time .
>>es<< and also it &apos;s time to make new system which makes us use easier and more simple , so far more people can enjoy computer more than before .
>>es<< despite amazing invention , some times computer makes big problem , such as millennium bug ( some people called &quot; 2000 problem &quot; ) , because computer not flexible enough like a human &apos;s brain .
>>es<< however , computer is worth to use in our life until more coveniance machine will be invented .
>>es<< so we &apos;ve decided at the end - of - conference party , we will have a buffet and a disco party .
>>es<< our students , then will get to know each other well .
>>es<< I would suggest everybody to wear a casual dresses .
>>es<< finally , I would recommend you and your group to enjoy shopping and sightseeing around Oxford Street and nearby .
>>es<< I look forward to see you and your group soon .
>>es<< your sincerely ,
>>es<< as you requested which is the interesting building to visit . I would strongly recommend the Barbican Centre building in the city .

>>es<< it is the Palace hotel , about a mile away where the conference will take place .

>>es<< I am looking forward seeing you
>>es<< the telephone a very important invention
>>es<< in my early childhood my mother said to me that when she has been a litte girl there has been only one telephone in the house where she had lived .
>>es<< it has been in her parents &apos; appartement .
>>es<< the neighbours had come into to make their calls and to get their calls .
>>es<< todays nobody could imagine such a situation .
>>es<< in every household there is a telephone at least .
>>es<< there are a lot of advantages for it .
>>es<< firstly people are able to talk to person on every time . be it : just for fun or also to discuss some important and relevant thins .
>>es<< moreover we always can call for help to the police , to the hospital or to a doctor .
>>es<< this could save life !
>>es<< an other advantage is that all offices , firms and industries could not further exist without it .
>>es<< all people know this situation ; people want not to be interrupted , maybe they are reading a book , having a good talk or are having a little sleep ... then the telephone rings ... !
>>es<< it is not an easy desicion how to react now .
>>es<< another point of disadvantage is that the mobile phones are ringing. everywhere and on every time .
>>es<< to sum up this invention is one of the most useful things .
>>es<< it is always the same how to people use it or not and how people handle it .
>>es<< thankyou for your letter , wich arrived yesterday .

>>es<< from there to the conference you have to take the bus number 50 , that stop near the hotel and arrive in town center .
>>es<< the conference is organised in the civic hall so it is very simple to found it .
>>es<< at the end of conference there is a party a perfect opportunity for your students meet new friends from all part of word and they could speak about their experience .
