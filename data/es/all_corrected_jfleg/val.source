>>es<< not for use with a car .
>>es<< here was no promise of morning , except that we looked up through the trees , and we saw how low the forest had swung .
>>es<< thus , even today , sex is considered as the least important topic in may parts of India .
>>es<< imagine yourself you are working in factory just to do one thing like put air a on car if they fire you you will be destroyed , because you do n &apos;t know more than to put air a in car .
>>es<< they draw in the consumers , like me , to purchase a great product with amazing ingredients , but actually , they just make up these words to increase their sales .
>>es<< I want to talk about nocive or bad products like alcohol , hair spray and cigarettes .
>>es<< for example , they can play football whenever they want , but the elders cannot .
>>es<< it features Diana Krall wearing a Rolex watch and the text suggests that if the reader wants to belong to a restricted club -- not necessarily of Rolex watch-wearers -- but of highly talented , sophisticated , competent artists , then he or she should also have a Rolex .
>>es<< there are several reasons .
>>es<< also , the work of the media , television , magazines and other things made for publicity impacts the emotions of many people around the world , encouraging them to buy everything they can .
>>es<< since most urban areas are occupied with cars , they are facing a problem of air and noise pollution .
>>es<< while it is true that consumers prefer to buy products with lower prices , when international companies that are already certified begin to send their products to market , people will prefer to consume those goods because the difference in price will probably not affect them too much .
>>es<< fourth , they have a great chance to prepare for their future life .
>>es<< if a person does n &apos;t have good health , so many things could be lost .
>>es<< many studies over the last 5 0 years have shown that people who have fluoride in their drinking water have considerably fewer cavities than people who are not drinking water with fluoride .
>>es<< likewise , the theory coming from the concept of memory is also not the appropriate way due to limited memory .
>>es<< they spent time in subjects that were not meaningful .
>>es<< I was very fast : my best time was 5 5 seconds in 4 0 0 hundred meters , and this is a good time in my country .
>>es<< and young people spend more time on their lifestyles .
>>es<< in this society , those who will not study will never grasp the concepts or understand any ideas , which is the most important point ; thus I am also very interested and prefer to have the study materials .
>>es<< this is a serious problem , but most people are unaware of it .
>>es<< students can focus on only a few subjects they are interested in and they will become experts in those areas .
>>es<< but in another way , this means the country needs to pay extra money to build and repair the roads ; what they did is reduce the amount of gas consumed , raise the gas tax , and lower the income tax because they thought only raising the gas tax is unfair .
>>es<< in the case of young people , the best way is to study as hard as possible to get better grades so in the future they will have a better chance to find a good job .
>>es<< so the school tries teaching the students a bit of every science which exists .
>>es<< I think they have to get skilled in it .
>>es<< specializing in one particular subject does not suit our lives in this era which is characterized by diversity and innovation .
>>es<< I will explain my point of view in the following paragraphs .
>>es<< he thinks differently than others and he has succeeded .
>>es<< these activities make the community a better place to live and include those values in all the members .
>>es<< all the broad knowledge helps them to understand their major in University classes , as well as help them to make a correct choice in a specialized area .
>>es<< I could very easily understand why he would always bring bad marks home .
>>es<< then , when we went to the Science Olympiad , she had diverse knowledge about the subjects , and it was not new for her to think about new things .
>>es<< if every person tries to learn and understand lots of scientific subjects , no person will do it and , as a result of this , no science will be improved .
>>es<< thus I agree wholeheartedly with the above : in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
>>es<< third , put it in the front of the door of the store so people see it , even if it is not good .
>>es<< however , are these things good to all people ?
>>es<< they will run out very soon at the current rate of utilization .
>>es<< in the lecture , however , the professor opposed reading the statement .
>>es<< you have to create these opportunities .
>>es<< throughout our lives , we need to talk about our families .
>>es<< in order to do this , they would need to learn additional skills , either theoretical or practical , that would increase their understanding and application of their chosen subject .
>>es<< if you want to develop a product you create a beautiful image around it if you want sell it .
>>es<< secondly , the location of the film must must be very clear and the director must be relaxed , etc .
>>es<< and it will put your mind into non-stop learning .
>>es<< this will prove the speeding offense so that the police can easily catch them .
>>es<< in today &apos;s world Computer skills are the first important life skill .
>>es<< lastly , he chose to learn the truth .
>>es<< I have never stopped myself to think this , but this is a real possibility for the future .
>>es<< young has his own field and works hard on it , and it provides more benefits to society .
>>es<< there are editors to review the new information .
>>es<< if we consider an idea as a totally autonomous concept within the individual process of defining reality , I think the ideas are useless , and not based on experience .
>>es<< he or she wants to know everything about the universe , God , and death , these are some concepts that everyone can encourage ideas , but no facts have been found yet .
>>es<< it so expensive that only those people can do this , factoring in their daily living expenses .
>>es<< they make very high profits year after year and the numbers also increase year after year .
>>es<< for this reason , the number of cars would decrease in the future .
>>es<< so he took it upon himself to narrow his research on this subject , which was a mystery to the world .
>>es<< others who do n &apos;t understand this concept sell uncertified wood .
>>es<< I did n &apos;t have self confidence .
>>es<< if there are specialized doctors that have done the operation often , he becomes talented in his job .
>>es<< it will be good situation .
>>es<< the school teachers there are the ones who create the future of the younger generation so we have to teach them better .
>>es<< this test is very important to them .
>>es<< but most of the time it is important because most students are not heard and their thoughts and ideas are very important .
>>es<< otherwise , it will be a problem for us to understand certain things in life .
>>es<< I myself like to participate in these kinds of activities and meet many people who like to do the same thing .
>>es<< second , the amount of treasure locations is implausibly large .
>>es<< he mainly concentrated on the questions that were asked of him at the time of the interview .
>>es<< my first reason is that when we learn about some subjects we should have more information about what we study so that we will learn easier and more effectively .
>>es<< in a market economy , the price must reflect the cost of the product and the consumer &apos;s willingness to buy the product .
>>es<< some tour guide will want to set maximum security to make the tour difficult because you will only have a wonderful view through the bus .
>>es<< because the fashion culture has changed .
>>es<< actually , that was an unstable trip .
>>es<< it was obvious after returning that I was tired , and the night is meant to sleep !
>>es<< nowadays , we need a person who is capable of all sorts of work .
>>es<< finally , fish farming relates to long-term wastefulness , which can pollute the sea .
>>es<< establishing connections with other researchers will open the door for new projects .
>>es<< he does not expect others to reciprocate his help .
>>es<< furthermore , my friends who are nineteen years old and drive their own car. they would still like to buy another one .
>>es<< as the cities were smaller , there was less violence , noise , traffic , etc .
>>es<< there cannot be any bothering and hassle .
>>es<< even though he knows the advertisement is not real , or looks too pretty , he is going to buy the product .
>>es<< these are several opposing points I observed between the lecture and the passage .
>>es<< even though she does not have a job , she also needs a car to pick up her kids or go shopping .
>>es<< in early industry , a lot of workers worked together .
>>es<< it kept Anasazi from living in the American southwest with very high temperatures and caused droughts .
>>es<< I have several reasons that support my choice .
>>es<< once you get success why would you not get it next time ?
>>es<< while at university , he might specialize in one subject while still taking a number of other diverse courses .
>>es<< now we have all the information at our disposal .
>>es<< both of these men have dealt with situations in an unconventional manner and the results are plain to see .
>>es<< this will affect exams .
>>es<< moreover , taking risks teaches you to accept both winning and losing , and that is the most important lesson one should learn in order to achieve any kind of objective .
>>es<< I would like to initiate whatever I do in order to get more out of my trip .
>>es<< it &apos;s normal , propose something to the client and make something different , it &apos;s the best way and it &apos;s legal !
>>es<< this is how we are transforming our society in the present day . the consequence of disagreeing with this statement is that we are looking at what we want in the moment in order to have a great time .
>>es<< not only this , but without a clear understanding of what is being taught , the student would not be able to perform well on the tests .
>>es<< for example : a man whose hobby is playing football , must want to play football day until night and night until day again .
>>es<< like the citizens of developed countries , these people want to possess cars themselves .
>>es<< we read on many subjects so we get ample exposure .
>>es<< but on the other hand there are also people that are often convinced by the interesting advertisements they see everywhere , because of this many times they have to face problems with the product that they bought and many times there is no way to give back that product .
>>es<< if they take responsibility for the future of society and the results , it may be the most helpful thing for society .
>>es<< so , the conclusion is clear .
>>es<< you can change your views and ideas but you can not change facts .
>>es<< an older person has to make way for a younger person , even if he does not like it .
>>es<< ever increasing competency rates force them into frequent business model changes for a compatible transitional flexibility .
>>es<< however , this reading passage casts doubts on the speaker &apos;s mention .
>>es<< that gives us a lot of opportunity to think .
>>es<< the placebo effect is not an illusion but real , so the drug was effected by the placebo effect .
>>es<< when I travel to see something , I do not know when it will be open or closed , and even though I check beforehand , it might suddenly close .
>>es<< its cost is half than the other but its life cycle is the same .
>>es<< what we do now , we can do later .
>>es<< according to me , there are two kind of studies : the highly technical ones and the others .
>>es<< thus , we begin to share information and ask our own questions about a weaker subject .
>>es<< for example , in the 2 0 0 6 World Cup form Germany , many coaches on a team work .
>>es<< many Scientists obtained clear results of investigations after the facts were on the table , but before they could even begin to theorize about them .
>>es<< this will give rise to holistic understanding .
>>es<< they want to make people understand that their product is the best and you can really trust it .
>>es<< there can be many other theories about the reasons for and methods of migration .
>>es<< thus , the environmental issue will encourage more people to consider ways to commute other than driving a car .
>>es<< video is convenient , but if teachers are concerned about students , using textbooks is a good ability for students .
>>es<< they tend to restrict traffic on certain days and hours , and increase parking fees , etc .
>>es<< so depending on the study it would be better one way or the other since the thing is to choose the right one .
>>es<< I am really sorry to continue this way , but right now I am taking the test in a room with five other people and we are all taking the test with computers .
>>es<< in my opinion , it is dependent on a particular person .
>>es<< many people are killed by cars .
>>es<< global warming and greenhouse effects have started recently .
>>es<< examples : if people who were good did something wrong , they could develop into thieves , robbers , or criminals and make problems for other people .
>>es<< for example when we talk about speed they must understand why it is dangerous it is better than if they have an accident and learn after that .
>>es<< therefore people will be able to live with the automobile society and nature for the future .
>>es<< then , what if the speaker explains the project wrong ?
>>es<< one car should be used by three people , so it will lessen the number of cars during the busy hours .
>>es<< and they can make a product and sell it cheaper than most countries .
>>es<< Marco Polo used the Persian langage , not Chinese or Mongolian .
>>es<< this is because of their knowledge on many subjects .
>>es<< the industry of the fishing affects the animals because , these companies used the fish in the making of different foods like oil .
>>es<< therefore , I brought a car immediately .
>>es<< although weather related factors should be considered , such as the land shape of the area .
>>es<< one of the reasons that the fish are important is the fish can be an important food for livestock and poultry .
>>es<< the policy is mentioned in the passage .
>>es<< such unwritten law is very serious , but our world is serious .
>>es<< think about and create a fire escape plan .
>>es<< finally , the third piece of evidence that birds use a type of internal compass is that birds have crystals of the mineral magnetite embedded in their break .
>>es<< if the teacher teaches them that , they will go on to study about that .
>>es<< just searching the internet , we can find out what we want , no matter how books may stimulate our imagination or how high quality the book is .
>>es<< in one case , for example the copper scroll notes merely that the treasure is hidden in the vicinity of a certain river .
>>es<< in this case , the student learned a concept that can be used in other fields .
>>es<< this is the cheapest way for people to take a trip .
>>es<< the lecturer says it is more important to provide enough fish to the people .
>>es<< furthermore , a tour guide will also provide safety and security for travel , since they already know the dos and don &apos;ts of the tour .
>>es<< on the other hand each academic field needs experts in order to progress .
>>es<< which caused her situation to worsen .
>>es<< for example one man is a football club fan .
>>es<< by using new things what are usually unknown to them , they are taking a risk .
>>es<< you can see that in many books , news programs , newspapers , TV shows , and websites .
>>es<< when many people were very young , they must have made time to learn , they did not have much time to enjoy life as much as possible .
>>es<< this argument is not only true now , it has always been .
>>es<< the last thing they have to study is disease , which means they will be safe .
>>es<< the consumers also knows how advertisements are .
>>es<< learn !
>>es<< there are very successful politicians that have never tried something new .
>>es<< you can become smarter than other people .
>>es<< in my opinion , this statement is groundless ; youngsters today do contribute to their communities to a great extent .
>>es<< and now because of this man I am writing my essay by computer .
>>es<< therefore , we have to reduce sulfur and nitrogen dioxide .
>>es<< most of the things I hear are not true .
>>es<< I think it is very hard to describe the point and to make everyone understand , because when a few people start to do so , they will think it is not fair at all , that they are the few who are suffering , and other people will not get it and will continue doing the same thing ; it just makes those people think stupidly .
>>es<< maybe at the beginning , but time after time other animals in the environment will choose them as their new food .
>>es<< the scraping will cause heat and that heat ( energy ) will go into the car .
>>es<< you will face huge difficulties in life if you do n &apos;t know at least something from every subject .
>>es<< the younger generation is more adaptable and can therefore adapt to changing technology .
>>es<< that is why I &apos;m here , to be ready for my education , that is , to be specialized in one specific subject that I would like to learn in every detail .
>>es<< furthermore the professor denies the reading passage which states that treasure does not exist and is just fiction .
>>es<< I chose law and began to study everything about Italian law .
>>es<< ideas on how you can solve this problem will actually give you a solution to the problem .
>>es<< after all , until now , I tried to stay on a diet and manage my health condition carefully .
>>es<< knowledge plays an important role in the life , which can be acquired by understanding concepts rather than learning things .
>>es<< most people do n &apos;t care about the environment or how cars affect the ozone layer greatly .
>>es<< in addition it has a negative influence on agriculture .
>>es<< they also have more responsibilities than a younger person .
>>es<< the professor said that this can be changed to the different environments .
>>es<< I , on the other hand , have no major responsibilities other than studying .
>>es<< the good student must know how to understand and work hard to get the idea .
>>es<< and the critics used few arguments .
>>es<< secondly , the information in the videos is in a common format , the students are familiar with it .
>>es<< the heart disease patients show improvement when they are taking a placebo .
>>es<< besides , young people usually like new-fashion things , like iPods or MP 3 players , I can see that the majority of young people ca n &apos;t live happily without music in their ears and movies at home .
>>es<< they go on and do it better .
>>es<< however , people do n &apos;t know there and they do n &apos;t know how to do better or what they ca n &apos;t do .
>>es<< producing vehicles that are more fuel efficient will damage roads and that will cost a lot to repair .
>>es<< measures should be taken to check the fish population .
>>es<< some say this product is recommended for the most important doctors , or something like that .
>>es<< this creates people to fall into peer pressure .
>>es<< and there are a lot of scientists who specialize in one specific subject that discover important concepts or invent things which make our society more convenient .
>>es<< for example , last month I bought a product for skin because the advertising got my attention .
>>es<< newer vehicles are something that could fly in the sky , the we need not worry about traffic jams .
>>es<< this offers you a lot more possibilities , and you can stay at the places you like and avoid the ones you do n &apos;t .
>>es<< but when we are in possession of these products , are we really living the dream ?
>>es<< the sulfur dioxide is generated by several natural and human processes .
>>es<< Menhadens are the primary source of protein for livestock and poultry .
>>es<< I understand people who think that funny movies are more interesting than the others , especially when you watch a movie with friends , because it allows you to have fun with them .
>>es<< while the child spends about five hours or less with his parents , and whenever that child wants to go out he will probably go out with his friends which are classmates , so most of his school life will be spent with his classmates and this will have a great impact on his personality which will determine the way the child will react towards his school and how he will live out his life .
>>es<< someone likes music , and someone likes science , and someone is talented in ballet while others are not .
>>es<< I believe that the number of cars may decrease in twenty years &apos; time for various reasons .
>>es<< a perfect example of real politics , was when Bismark manipulated the letter written by the king and sent it to the French emperor Napoleon III .
>>es<< in this case , a tour guide can be helpful to complete the trip in less time as compared to what one might end up spending if one decides to explore the place alone .
>>es<< what I wanted to say is , that enjoying life cannot be put into a definition to test out if somebody is enjoying his or her life because it matches this definition .
>>es<< but the owner that possesses one car dealer shop offered to him the other job with better conditions and benefits .
>>es<< it &apos;s very obvious that more cars will be sold there .
>>es<< also , a food chain becomes stronger than it was before , such as rabbits and bears .
>>es<< for older people , the phone &apos;s only function , in some ways , is a job or project , where a master will call on him to help with related jobs .
>>es<< according to me , in order to start the carrier through its &apos; success , it`s important to have a solid base , that means knowledge and experience .
>>es<< yes , that &apos;s right , but there are some young people that think about the idealism of their country , about their communities in Indonesia , about their friend who ca n &apos;t eat or go to school .
>>es<< the time to take a risk can be validated by consulting with others who are more professional than I am in sorting out the issues or solving risky problems .
>>es<< however , after the recommended burning , the forests can grow plentiful , and farmers can get more work than before .
>>es<< maybe doing what they already know how to do is better than to be annoyed with something new .
>>es<< technology has grown so fast because everyone tries to work on an invention due to some ideas he developed and concepts that have been applied to this idea from different subject areas .
>>es<< hence from the very beginning , children form a hesitancy to interact with other people , which time only solidifies .
>>es<< he actually changed the way he played in the latter part of his career , when he won all those championships .
>>es<< we will continue to invent and produce more sophisticated technology based on our own comfort , which will decrease our ability to perform physical activities .
>>es<< in my opinion , if they start one subject , never give it up .
>>es<< this contradicts the passage that it is a bad influence to economics .
>>es<< the purpose of traveling is using a lot of your time to release your mind , is n &apos;t it ?
>>es<< the bass is not only a predator for menhaden , so if people catch more bass , the population of other fish will also grow .
>>es<< today they are using this method as a curative measure , but with increasing importance of preventative medicine , normal healthy individuals are leaning towards not using cars whenever possible .
>>es<< this shows that people are aware of the disadvantages of getting old , and getting less pleasure from life , and try to delay or disguise it in any possible way .
>>es<< in fact , we will need a lot of space to park all these cars , so we need a project for this .
>>es<< government uses that money for public use and safety .
>>es<< second , sphinx is known for an Old Kingdom king .
>>es<< or , &quot; is this the right thing to do ? &quot;
>>es<< I started to have an interest in math , and spent a lot of time solving math problems , and I got a good score on exams , it makes me have more passion about math .
>>es<< even after school , he has to participate in games , and other extra curricular activities , that are compulsory to attend .
>>es<< he has a lot of money and a name , but no family life .
>>es<< even though the place I went was Kyoto , which is the most beautiful city in Japan , they have interesting temples , nothing really remains in my mind after the trip because I was just part of a group following a tour guide without thinking .
>>es<< broad knowledge on may subjects is not possible to acquire .
>>es<< I also think that the AD is a method to make the people happy , because you can dream .
>>es<< however , his trying still brings him to success .
>>es<< since I was in a group , I should respect the group rules .
>>es<< one good way to be safe and have a good time is to travel with a group , and find a good tour guide .
>>es<< I think that there is nothing I want in this tired city , so why would father and mother want to visit it ?
>>es<< the lecturer went against the author &apos;s insistence for the following reasons .
>>es<< in addition , once he told me that he will never take the risk of doing other work because he has been working on this for 1 2 years and is already fluent at it .
>>es<< for example , the most famous inventor , Thomas Edison , was asked a question when he applied for a loan to a bank one more time for his experiments , which were failing .
>>es<< they behave as though they were just spontaneously praising a product during normal conversation .
>>es<< to my surprise , nothing happened .
>>es<< for example , they do not like to wait .
>>es<< like the lecturer suggests , we could subsidize the poor , and this policy helps to put the right price on our natural resources and environment .
>>es<< they can bring that problem for improvement to many companies that will produce a new product .
>>es<< education is the basis of opportunities , and the amount of subjects in which a person has knowledge , provides more opportunities in all aspects of life like work and helping others .
>>es<< it usually makes them more positive to do it .
>>es<< in both advertisements it is said that these tooth pastes will make your teeth brilliant and brighter .
>>es<< we must trust ourselves .
>>es<< that seems what people live for .
>>es<< insufficient closet space , inefficient heating , and decaying plumbing makes life harder to live in old houses .
>>es<< the advertisement says that the car has space for ten people , when the truth is that the car just has space for four people ; another example is a skin soap advertisement that says the soap is the best because it will make your skin as soft as a 1 5 year old princess or as soft as the skin of Jennifer Lopez .
>>es<< that means people that have something that is specialized in one subject could have a better chance of being hired .
>>es<< and Chimps can also remember what researchers said , and almost perfect repeat what they said .
>>es<< he will consider himself losing the years that he spent on collecting the money .
>>es<< in addition , the technology on which these mass transport systems function , are based primarily on non-conventional sources of energy .
>>es<< of course it has the risk of failing , but imagine the fantastic sensation of victory if his second bakery is as much as successful as the first one .
>>es<< there are many people that do n &apos;t think before making a choice .
>>es<< third , although the passage claims they are dinosaurs because their bone structure is similar to endothermy , scientist assume that it is not the case .
>>es<< ten years ago , a family that consists of five members owned at least two cars and that satisfied their transportation needs .
>>es<< for example we can see on the discovery Channel in the wild many people enjoy learning about the animals .
>>es<< actual markets require more specific knowledge than broad knowledge .
>>es<< only by breaking out of your normal life can you discover new perspectives in your job and your private life .
>>es<< I said yes .
>>es<< when you are successful , you will have reasons to live .
>>es<< the important thing is traveling without a tour guide .
>>es<< lawyers are usually young people .
>>es<< extending the same example as stated above , I can tell you that during the worst period of Amitabh Bacchan , he was offered a job in politics to take advantage of his publicity and would be paid heavily for it , he was very much in need of financial support , but Mr. Bacchan rejected this offer because he knew how politicians play with the emotions of common people .
>>es<< and when we want those energy sources , we need to extract them from the ground and soil or oceans , because those energy types are found in those places .
>>es<< new plants could not grow after the fires .
>>es<< people who are realistic can be more successful , as we can see throughout history .
>>es<< they are not stopping at the same time .
>>es<< it means , to understand war development , you should understand the ideas and cultural movements that resulted in a particular period , and helped for the occurring of that war , for example .
>>es<< a different passage emphasizes an alternative to prescribed burning that uses the term &quot; disking , &quot; a method that uses fire to clear out dry and dead shrubs , thus stimulating the growth of new plant life .
>>es<< this saved valuable time one can invest in more important activities .
>>es<< but , even if this student passes the course , he / she will not be a successful lawyer in the future about contracts .
>>es<< in other words , the variety of these towns might yield some changes that would encourage people who are interested in old things .
>>es<< that shows that few animals could sustain and be active in this harsh and cold environment .
>>es<< the way I see it , the only thing that guides do is limit you , and even more when you &apos;re in a group .
>>es<< these ideas and concepts usually contain academic researches that are totally reliable and dependent on the facts .
>>es<< from this , the professor agreed with some ideas and disagreed with some ideas .
>>es<< but , I went to Jeju Island more than three times .
>>es<< I would have a variety of answers subjective to each person &apos;s field of interest .
>>es<< the second one is to specialize in one specific subject : one has his own test to study for , so let us talk about this subject .
>>es<< I think that the car , twenty years from now , will use electric fuel , and not gasoline .
>>es<< after this effort , many companies in the world started actions to get this eco certified .
>>es<< is it right ?
>>es<< any user who has used any toothpaste definitely knows that this can never be true .
>>es<< after the construction of the first commercial car in 1 9 0 8 , the Ford T , mankind has been subdued to the use of the car .
>>es<< everybody loves him , and he does as well .
>>es<< successful people have gone through lots of hardship .
>>es<< young people are still trying to obtain experience , while older people have it already .
>>es<< hence , ideas and concepts are more reliable than the facts .
>>es<< take toys for example , advertisements that target children in particular are the best example of the way advertisements create a false image of the product .
>>es<< the car was our answer to the needs of transportation sixty years ago , and they will continue to be twenty more years from now .
>>es<< they need cars for many things such as transportation , entertainment , and business .
>>es<< because of the commitments men have to make to go to the army , men have to sacrifice their precious time of youth .
>>es<< if scientist will do something different like modifying the form of carbohydrate ( gelatinized and non-gelatinized ) , and then incorporating that into fish feed then fish may have a greater chance of growth and then be utilized more efficiently much to the appreciation of everyone .
>>es<< while the results from both experiences are same , the method and the time that brings a result is not the same .
>>es<< because you do not need to be a hero in order to try new things , you just need to want it and know that any result will be a success in things that you want or in learning .
>>es<< in such a situation , there is no other way .
>>es<< in the Reach family , all members have a car .
>>es<< I held the map and tried to find all the famous points that it had marked on it .
>>es<< even the magnitudes on Mars are no evidence of life on Mars .
>>es<< for example , when I traveled to France and Italy alone , I met a person in Nice who was a famous producer of the song in Taiwan .
>>es<< finding oil and petrol , and digging for it , is a very expensive procedure .
>>es<< I hope the things I learned will help me in the future .
>>es<< for these reasons , the passage said that it is time for the state to take measures to reduce the quantity of sulfur dioxide .
>>es<< I think there must be many subjects better than just one subject .
>>es<< also , the animal population got better and recovered really well after the fire .
>>es<< it provides a lot of wood to the industries .
>>es<< some loose points in the wall .
>>es<< the gas byproducts from cars will destroy the earth &apos;s environment and increase its temperature .
>>es<< in writing we are nearly unable to express people &apos;s feelings , but via action on TV we can understand these feelings better than from books .
>>es<< everybody knows that today , the truth of competitive markets in each and every field , we &apos;re facing plenty of competition , and if you are choosing a career in the field of software , for example , you have to master the subject and then you can easily get a job .
>>es<< because you share only a single interest , it makes you a loner .
>>es<< in addition , students want to learn the language and they want to use it , so when they understand the concepts and the ideas , it will help them to learn the language .
>>es<< indeed , they can be refused .
>>es<< unfortunately , we are individuals living isolated in society .
>>es<< but if they need money for these purposes , they can work extra hard .
>>es<< learn .
>>es<< however , after I learned all aspects of a company such as marketing , accounting , leadership , financial accounting , and business communication etc ..
>>es<< an example that confirms , or supports , my point clearly is the Chinese car .
>>es<< furthermore , it is way better to have knowledge than to guess and learn common facts that anyone could learn through the media .
>>es<< it is the main resource that cars need to run .
>>es<< from my personal experience , when I was too busy to find the information , the internet was a very useful and fast tool .
>>es<< but then , as it has been rightly said by someone , &quot; We are the victims of our own greedy needs . &quot;
>>es<< but by then , we have already bought the product and end up losing the money .
>>es<< and we say that these countries are going to be the next developed countries .
>>es<< my 1 0th exam and 1 2th exam are very good .
>>es<< if they learn one thing , they will learn another until they know how it works and what the useful aspects of it .
>>es<< I am sure that most of the kids knew that this was not the way their parents taught them , because they do not know why it was wrong or why they should do things the ways their parents told them to .
>>es<< we can see young people working with other countries and other people with tools like the telephone or internet , even if it looks like they are spending time just for themselves by spending the whole day in their room .
>>es<< also , most people prefer to entertain athletics rather than the arts .
>>es<< therefore , he likes to do risky and strange things , and he enjoys it .
>>es<< but after a few days , I found myself enjoying it .
>>es<< however , if they just work in the field which they already know how to do well , they might feel sad and tired .
>>es<< I believe to specialize in one specific subject outweighs having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
>>es<< in my opinion , if someone thinks one is more important than the other , why not focus on one ?
>>es<< and people feel more awkward when it comes to their ears that this is something that is a current event .
>>es<< however , I would prefer traveling by myself , with good preparation , and be filled with joy .
>>es<< carbon dioxide is very harmful to people .
>>es<< and I had to listen to &quot; Success attracts Success and Money attracts Money . &quot;
>>es<< also , they can go shopping and buy new fashionable clothes .
>>es<< it &apos;s a really good film .
>>es<< after that , I studied the topic in more depth and understood the ideas and concepts of the topic .
>>es<< when the forest is caught on fire , the wood turns into ashes _ _ which is potassium .
>>es<< in my opinion , cars will become self-driving in twenty years .
>>es<< the fact of the matter is that a lot of academic subjects can not be used separately .
>>es<< according to the lecture , management should plan carefully by hiring well-trained people or teach current employees how to be prepared for a fire .
>>es<< in old age , people leave all their burdens behind and spend their time on work they &apos;re interested in .
>>es<< although some people say that the treasures are already found .
>>es<< as far as I am concerned , I agree with this statement , but some people may not agree with my opinion .
>>es<< car usage in the United States is very important in every day life , as well as in many Latin American countries , and third world countries .
>>es<< however , companies tend to cut their profits for workers .
>>es<< this one is the copper scroll .
>>es<< another solution could be the developing of more fuel efficient cars , which could also be good for American car manufacturers who will produce more attractive cars to sell to other countries .
>>es<< consequently , I agree with the statement for three reasons : effect on one &apos;s view , talking face to face with people , and meeting for the first time .
>>es<< therefore , the problem of running out of fuel is out of the question , augumenting my view that the number of cars will continue to rise .
>>es<< first effect is global warming .
>>es<< so , Ho Chi Minh city will develop .
>>es<< Peolple like to drive different types of models and they want something extra in it .
>>es<< these useful skills that I learned from reality are going to be the greatest gifts for my future career , and they can not be found in textbooks , anyway .
>>es<< that &apos;s why I will not be as hard as when I am alone .
>>es<< this is an important thing .
>>es<< books sometimes contain outdated information so they may be wrong .
>>es<< to combat those problems , people started to use cheaper transportation instead of cars .
>>es<< however , I agree that having knowledge is useful whenever we need necessary information .
>>es<< but when the teacher asked me did I understand it , I said yes .
>>es<< so , I disagree with the statement and I think it is much better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
>>es<< raising the gas tax could be the most effective way to decrease gas consumption for three reasons .
>>es<< next , kids are more attracted to the advertisements .
>>es<< successful people can explain any other matter and discuss any other problem .
>>es<< but it is dangerous because some drivers make trouble with other drivers and then the drivers crash their cars when the streets are busy .
>>es<< because it is already fixed data , nobody can create a problem with this type of literature .
>>es<< also , the professor indicates that we should be careful when we use the prescribed fire solution .
>>es<< if they cannot pay the high prices anymore , people have to start using a bus or a train .
>>es<< this will reduce the pollution caused by cars releasing carbon dioxide .
>>es<< moreover , they have to learn about advanced course material .
>>es<< sometimes age , in my view , is a barrier to some things in life .
>>es<< in simple words , they say they lost their appeal .
>>es<< for example , nursing students study in a nursing college for three to four years .
>>es<< I believe that the product &apos;s quality mentioned in the shops is exactly the same as given in the ads .
>>es<< then define your goals and work hard to achieve them .
>>es<< critics of this policy focus on three points ; first , Yellowstone fires scorched a large area of land , and a lot of plant species were lost .
>>es<< in my past experiences , there are some lectures which are completely based on facts , and there is a slim chance for me to apply them .
>>es<< when you understand the idea is one way you can figure out the statement that you see in the moment .
>>es<< however , a lot of reasons explain what the placebo effect does .
>>es<< in today &apos;s world , there is a high and almost undying thirst for change .
>>es<< firstly , I think that communities equal human relationships .
>>es<< it may spoil the health , also .
>>es<< water is necessary to live .
>>es<< I &apos;ve seen many times on TV the same people , rich people , who are interested in politics , sports , new technologies , and also in space .
>>es<< as a result , studies in Britain have shown that fluoride increases the activity that can lead to more bone density and , therefore , less bone fractures among the elderly .
>>es<< also , sometimes , people may meet some new friends in the group they are traveling with .
>>es<< if students just learn facts they would just forget them , but this would not happen so easily if they understand properly the concepts behind the facts .
>>es<< when I started completing my homework on time , I gradually improved .
>>es<< because if I study in this way , I will gain so much , and I also will have a lot of information from the books .
>>es<< when you understand the concepts and ideas , it is up to you to prove them , to see if they are really what you have been told , and I think this is the main reason why students prefer facts rather than just understanding ideas and concepts .
>>es<< for example , if you are attempting to study arts and sciences , and are trying to get qualifications in both , you are an extraordinary creation .
>>es<< the government will try to do something to not pollute the air .
>>es<< so in this field , it is very important to understand all the concepts and ideas they gave us and use them to solve problems .
>>es<< because they sent out 2 0 % of all carbon emissions .
>>es<< in my opinion is so easy to understand one thing ( for example , processes ) than to remember many divided facts or dates .
>>es<< it is also necessary to take risks rather than just doing what you are supposed to .
>>es<< there will be a technological development in the future , but it will only promote the use of public transportation systems , not personal cars .
>>es<< not being with a guide gives you the liberty to visit the places you want to visit at your own pace and with the liberty to go anywhere you want to go .
>>es<< usually in advertisements a presentable face is used to present a product , such as a model , a cute baby , or a known face , such as a sportsmen , only to get the product to look better than it actually is .
>>es<< not that bungee jumping is something that every young person wants to do , but , even if he wanted to do it , he probably would n &apos;t be able to .
>>es<< close-up video clips of a juicy hamburger flying around the screen , clearly satisfying the model eating it , could easily create in viewers a false sense of being hungry and urge them to hop in a car and drive to a nearby fast food restaurant to buy what they saw .
>>es<< as we have all known , when we were out , something we ca n &apos;t expect would happen , such as disease , an accident , or something else .
>>es<< and then , makers of cars need to develop the systems for safety almost completely .
>>es<< third , the professor agrees that the gas prices in the United States are cheap , and they should raise them to save the environment and people &apos;s health .
>>es<< nowadays , there are many people who think they are the most important thing and they only have to work for themselves .
>>es<< in general , there are many people in the book .
>>es<< but they do things in a different manner than others do , which gives them success .
>>es<< people feel more secure and comfortable to travel with their own car rather than travel using several public transportation vehicles to reach their destination far later than they would desire .
>>es<< the second critique of this method is that the costumer loses all critical though and that he is not on guard .
>>es<< I think it &apos;s harder for a successful person to risk something becuase they could lose much more than others .
>>es<< we can have a glance of what &apos;s happening in the world by accessing the internet using mobile devices , also .
>>es<< so the importance of communities in society decreased .
>>es<< but found that successful people use money from other people , and use their ideas , for a way to success .
>>es<< in my case , when I did a job interview , the employer asked me commonsense questions about society , policy , art , and so on .
>>es<< at some time they have to face their failures and struggles .
>>es<< because it transmits Eastern European habits to different places in the world .
>>es<< consider a family going shopping over the weekend .
>>es<< the other reason is many people see exotic cars as luxury items , and that encourages the car industry .
>>es<< in my opinion , I think advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
>>es<< so , some people use their car only for moving somewhere .
>>es<< they have to think twice before performing even routine activities in life .
>>es<< most of the actors , soldiers , workers , and students , are young people .
>>es<< to respond adequately to the world we live in , we need to understand it first .
>>es<< in fact , even today most of these systems run on electricity , which can be harnessed in several , non-polluting , ways .
>>es<< compared to older people , they do n &apos;t have enough time to enjoy their life .
>>es<< also it has been on all the sections because when we use the head phones it makes a lot of noise and it is seriously very hard to stay on task .
>>es<< they are clean , big , and so on .
>>es<< and a rolling stone gathers no moss , says proverb .
>>es<< it is difficult to only watch lectures .
>>es<< and there are a lot of critics concerned that the required testing is too long to be valuable for patients .
>>es<< I have a reason to study English .
>>es<< for example , little children are told not to cross the street at a red light because it is dangerous , and we should n &apos;t let kids learn from a car crash .
>>es<< in my opinion , students need knowledge .
>>es<< so because more people are able to buy cars , the demand for , and production of , cars will increase , and , in the end , this means that the number of cars will increase in twenty years &apos; time .
>>es<< first , they have spent too much time using computers , so they do n &apos;t know how to properly communicate .
>>es<< we know that prescribed burning should be repeated every few years , but it &apos;s very expensive to prescribe burnings every few years .
>>es<< the second difference between the encyclopedia and information on the Internet is that there are a lot of viruses and hackers on the Internet , and hackers can easily change information regarding any topic .
>>es<< for example , if I want to win a case in court in which technical questions are to be considered , it is not enough to just know about the law .
>>es<< second , determine if there is any problem with the goods .
>>es<< some people might say &quot; hey , how does energy come ? &quot;
>>es<< successful people try to do new things , like use any machine that could possibly help people .
>>es<< however , the problem is how long will it take us to find out that we are actually being controlled by the advertisements and the perfect image they gave us .
>>es<< hence , German students will have to work harder , think much more , and , thus , become even more skilled .
>>es<< one reason is that endangered animals are breaking nature .
>>es<< so I think that having self-confidence is more important than having knowledge .
>>es<< a younger person , however , will need time to define his , or her , wants in life .
>>es<< the work should be good and not just a meaningless bundle .
>>es<< natural disasters will always bring damage to the economy .
>>es<< it &apos;s rightly said that life is not about adding years to life , but life to years .
>>es<< first , advertisements make me want to puchase things I did n &apos;t plan to buy .
>>es<< there are two major reasons : it is beneficial to socialization and to mental health .
>>es<< for these reasons , I have to get a high score on the TOEFL exam .
>>es<< I believe this number is increasing , and will continue to increase , as generations of educated people pass on their wisdom to their children .
>>es<< in my opinion , the need for community service and volunteerism arises in the absence of adequate resources , or when somebody is not fulfilling their responsibilities .
>>es<< when I consumed that drink , I came to understand that we should not believe in advertisements .
>>es<< they just impress upon people so well that people are compelled to buy it .
>>es<< since I liked the interior so much , I bought the car a few days later .
>>es<< exactly like the phrase &quot; jack of all trades , master of none . &quot;
>>es<< the economy would benefit because this would enable it to compete with car manufacturers worldwide .
>>es<< he and I are good pals , but we do n &apos;t want to get lower scores than each other .
>>es<< it is composed of not only seniors , but also university students .
>>es<< and if you have knowledge in all areas , then it gives you an added advantage to you knowledge level .
>>es<< that is because if I became a member , I would be highly esteemed by my friends .
>>es<< so governments and scientists are also promoting less use of private cars because they are one of the greatest attributers to air pollution .
>>es<< people use public water to drink .
>>es<< this is not very easy to use .
>>es<< but in my opinion , if you want to be a successful person , you should be brave , try new things , and take risks .
>>es<< on the other hand , scientists agree that the predators are beneficial to control the population of the menhaden .
>>es<< do we consider her a smart girl ?
>>es<< for example , in a chemistry class when you talk about oxygen being needed for a burning process , you can provide a fact to support your idea , which might be that you can put out a fire with a blanket because it cuts off the oxygen .
>>es<< who we match them together with .
>>es<< they explain specific points by using examples of the dinosaurs behavior and physical appearance .
>>es<< the lecture mentioned the Mongol court records of the time .
>>es<< it is harmful to people , animals , and it pollutes water sources .
>>es<< firstly , a teacher teaches students the right way to do things and affords confidence to students .
>>es<< we do n &apos;t usually study these subjects very deeply .
>>es<< for instance , many people use airplanes , ships , and trains .
>>es<< as a former law teacher at the University of Belgrano , I have experienced the problems students faced when taking their oral law examinations .
>>es<< first reason being that students are very open to criticism and always have many ideas to develop their opinions .
>>es<< they may go to the house where the elderly person lives and help the elderly person to eat food , and walk .
>>es<< there are many big streets in my town .
>>es<< the young passed the disease to a couple of people here , and the young are still enjoying life .
>>es<< it would be a really wasteful idea .
>>es<< for example , they can read again , if they want , back to the page that they cannot understand , or they are impressed by .
>>es<< tour guides are generally trained and certified by some supervising entities , therefore they are expected to be ready to provide the best possible guides to their customers .
>>es<< however , I still believe that learning facts are important for the student .
>>es<< while you will be able to help each other and work together after graduating from university .
>>es<< he usually brings a book and asks someone when he wants to understand the book .
>>es<< the operation room is not a bookmaker office or lottery house .
>>es<< this means that the more languages you know , the better you can communicate in and travel to other countries .
>>es<< recently , scientists have been working on a new generation lie detector that can perform brain-scanning to find out if a person telling the truth .
>>es<< by keeping his focus on one industry , or one subject , he ensures that he is up-to-date and fully aware of all the current happenings in the industry , or subject .
>>es<< they had success and the power .
>>es<< it will always be a plus for them .
>>es<< there is going to be a huge market for the product if the product is totally brand new , which makes for a large chance to make lots of money .
>>es<< before it was n &apos;t like that , back then we were , at all times , at the will of the man , and depending , economically , on him .
>>es<< when you are a teenager , you start experiencing some sexual changes , which , in contrast , changes your way of thinking , thinking more about the other gender than thinking about toys , and enjoying going out with some friends than staying home and playing with your toys .
>>es<< avoiding this will create a much purer and more natural world for our future generations to live in .
>>es<< firstly , some emergent events happening in other countries , or areas , may happen in the place you live someday in future .
>>es<< I feel that with the environmentally friendly benefits , and with the attachment that society already has on cars , the benefits will make people keep riding cars .
>>es<< I do not want to go to the Eiffel Tower in Paris , or The Statue of Liberty in New York , when I travel because they are too well known , so I have already heard about and seen them .
>>es<< others would like to spend more time shopping than going around places .
>>es<< I feel this will give jobs to people because all car companies would have to adjust with this change from gas to water fuel use .
>>es<< so it is complex ; looking after many new employees every year can be difficult .
>>es<< in this case , the advertisement totally makes an impact on that baby .
>>es<< maybe they enjoyed life when they were younger , too .
>>es<< lastly , business owners thought factories would help reduce their overall business expenses by reducing their transportation costs .
>>es<< when a talk about research , I mean ask people that had the product , like friends , family , or go to forums on the Internet .
>>es<< as it is important to see your work in the context of your whole career , he now benefits from his broadly chosen majors in college .
>>es<< successful people have to do things they find stable and do what they already know how to do well .
>>es<< there are bigger populations everywhere .
>>es<< this person guides you through paradise and takes you to wonderful places .
>>es<< really successful people gained their fortunes by trying something new , something that no one else has ever done before , and taking risks where people were too afraid to .
>>es<< and you stand nowhere on any subject .
>>es<< in this way , anybody can reach success in his , or her , life and career .
>>es<< there will be a lot of members that will have gone to the surface of the Moon , and they will return safely to Earth .
>>es<< without facts , ideas , or concepts , will not be developed .
>>es<< for example , when I was a freshman at Meiji University in Japan , my classmates and I traveled to China .
>>es<< in this case , older people can drink and can go to a lot of places such as night clubs , bars , and so on .
>>es<< a specialist , in any field , will have better job opportunities offered to him , and , of course , he will not have as many opportunities , but whatever the opportunities , they will be far better that what non-specialists are offered .
>>es<< second , many of the disadvantages cars have will cease , or decrease , in the coming years , which will make them more popular than what they are presently .
>>es<< nowadays the drinking of soda is an addiction to most people .
>>es<< thus a series of people got together and asked the guide to change the schedule , and the guide could not help but accept their opinions .
>>es<< this system of economics is the best .
>>es<< he pointed out that the climate plays a role in the erosion of materials .
>>es<< if we are doing a job we like , we will love doing that job no matter how difficult it is .
>>es<< if you want to actually get to know someone , or something , you can spend the whole day with that person , or place , and if you do not , you would n &apos;t have reason to even speak to that person , or even go there .
>>es<< an unsuspecting user cannot tell the century has been tampered with .
>>es<< usually I do n &apos;t want to be by myself in an unfamiliar place .
>>es<< I think cars will not be completely replaced by new automobile innovations , but they will certainly be fewer in numbers .
>>es<< now I am a really happy girl because I found my confidence .
>>es<< these advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are .
>>es<< but in contrast , the professor states in the lecture that it is impossible that the video is not expensive .
>>es<< does age actually have an impact on the way you live your life ?
>>es<< robots can work all day , and no one would be tired .
>>es<< eventually some of them wanted to buy the product .
>>es<< successful therapists know that one treatment can help one person , but for a different person it may not be appropriate .
>>es<< in today &apos;s world , we have just developed the first aspect .
>>es<< I had lots of problems with studying science .
>>es<< the professor needs them to do a project .
>>es<< and when you order a Big Mac , and see the size of it , it &apos;s nothing compared to what you see in commercials , so anytime I see one , I feel like throwing it in their face .
>>es<< but I cannot use my model as my only inspiration to design a building .
>>es<< although life is never easy , age does n &apos;t ensure you can be protected from bad things .
>>es<< it is called &quot; ballast water . &quot;
>>es<< if there are more people like me , the fashion market would develop .
>>es<< the student must be capable of understanding ideas and concepts , and , at the same time , know the way how they must be developed .
>>es<< we are also able to deal with the problems found with it .
>>es<< the companies want to show their product as best as they can once in the competitive market , and , in this race , they generally mislead the consumer .
>>es<< first of all , the lecturer thinks that using the gas tax to reduce the number of gas consumers is not good for economics .
>>es<< but if he did one machine like that , he , if he wanted , can do another differently , but he does n &apos;t think that because he does n &apos;t know his own abilities .
>>es<< but being that we are young , our body generates the new cells .
>>es<< it is a brilliant idea , and you know that you are really good working with small boys and girls , but you have to risk your work , your salary , and , with this , almost your life for an idea that may , or may not , work .
>>es<< it &apos;s modern life now .
>>es<< briefly , sharing the cost of a vacation trip is beneficial for travel .
>>es<< there are youths who acquire immense pleasure and self satisfaction from helping in the community .
>>es<< in order to get an eco-certification , many wood companies around the world have introduced new ecologically friendly practices .
>>es<< she knows just what the teacher has told her , but nothing more .
>>es<< when I have been to Europe using this , I save lots of money .
>>es<< the last one is the proposed limit on menhaden fishing , which could mean the reduction of this problem not only here , but also in several countries .
>>es<< even if the status of cars are still at the presently viewed as viable , something else will , of course , take the place of cars in our lives , and history tells us that advancement will never stop .
>>es<< on admission to the university , the subject breaks down in many subjects .
>>es<< they would use bicycles due to their relatively cheap cost and minimal need for maintenance .
>>es<< it will be unfair because it would affect low-income Americans much more seriously than well-to-do Americans , and listening to the part where the woman explains her reality does not reflect the real economic damages raising gasoline tax would do to low-income Americans .
>>es<< this might contribute to a decreasing number of cars , especially , in developed countries like we find in Europe , for example .
>>es<< people who are trying to get into a good university study by themselves everyday , while I play around without reviewing and studying .
>>es<< but that is a different situation , because the graduate , at this stage , will have already guaranteed his / her bachelor &apos;s degree .
>>es<< when facing such challenges , only those who are perseverant , determined , and always strive until the last minute , despite of the risks , can be successful .
>>es<< I was so mad at the tour , I , since then , like to travel by myself and without a tour .
>>es<< but they are not examples for the whole &quot; young person community . &quot;
>>es<< and governments will not provide good public transportation systems for many years later .
>>es<< people are not dependent on other people or time schedules , for example , of trains , trams , and buses .
>>es<< 1 7-5 0 people were surveyed about being required to take all classes and having selective classes .
>>es<< for example , no one is going to ask his personal doctor , which he sees when he has a flu , if he can also perform heart surgery or transplant organs .
>>es<< as a young person you participate in some high risk sports , like , for example , mountain climbing , but high a risk sport would be too hard for an old person participate in .
>>es<< we ca n &apos;t stay on the Internet for a long time .
>>es<< they bring us to far places in a quite fast speed without much human , physical , exertion .
>>es<< and people are not ready to pay the taxes .
>>es<< furthermore , with this evidence , you will agree .
>>es<< we are going to pink &apos;s hot Dog .
>>es<< in old times , families tended to live in the same place for ages .
>>es<< however , many companies joined them that also sell textiles .
>>es<< and details are the key element here , especially in the academic domain .
>>es<< for example , my parents went on a group tour to my country of Korea last summer .
>>es<< with this you can learn and gain knowledge .
>>es<< people are not , and should n &apos;t be , robots .
>>es<< I think that young people are not able to think as deeply on things as older people .
>>es<< cars became important things in our life .
>>es<< my friends are celebrating at the party .
>>es<< for instance , when I was a university student , I researched and reported about community history in groups .
>>es<< thus , most of the inhabitants in rural areas are the old ones .
>>es<< this is very positive for the company and probably he will get a better position .
>>es<< on one hand you have the general practitioners who look at all the basic problems related to the body , while on the other hand you have the specialists who only take care of specific areas , whether it be an orthopedic surgeon ( related to bones ) , a cardiologist ( related to the heart ) or an ENT ( ear , nose , throat ) surgeon .
>>es<< the definition of young or old is not apparent .
>>es<< all knowledge is connected .
>>es<< first , hunters are the most dangerous things in this world for birds .
>>es<< thus , in my view , the points made in the lecture surely challenges the specific details , or the points , made in the reading passage more effectively .
>>es<< the reason these problems occur is also because of the exam .
>>es<< what would be its environmental impact ?
>>es<< this point affects the environments of the world in the case of wasting the energy .
>>es<< he might feel afraid or terrible when the same thing happens to him .
>>es<< some people might give you a good plan .
>>es<< when older people think like that , it creates a big problem for young people .
>>es<< many scientists searched the area , but could n &apos;t find particles .
>>es<< the question : which is more important , making students understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts , can be answered based on the level of learning which the student is taking .
>>es<< some people have said that a placebo is really a drug , about 3 0 percent of patients agree with this idea .
>>es<< they can get a great amount of money from these companies .
>>es<< the delicious golden Fries seen on television might actually be pale potato stumps , fried almost to perfection in very , very , very old oil .
>>es<< therefore the government in America should propose to raise the gasoline tax .
>>es<< it will eat insects or animals that do damage to it so that it can avoid having to repair itself .
>>es<< parents now have less time to bring up their children , so grandparents might help them more frequently .
>>es<< after that they have to find a well paying job .
>>es<< but about myself I &apos;m gonna have it too because my brother always talks about it and i agree with that broad knowledge .
>>es<< and it does n &apos;t matter if the people who take the risks achieve all the goals they had in mind ; what is important is that they made things and have proved that they can do a lot of things in their lives by always focusing on good results for themselves and the whole world .
>>es<< I once read a report that said during the Vietnam war , more Americans died on roads in their cars than on battlefield .
>>es<< I know Bill Gates , president of Windows Media , is the richest man in the world .
>>es<< with facts , the students can only guess about the reasons behind the facts .
>>es<< the cost of undergrad is very cheap in some countries , such as France .
>>es<< for example , it happened to me when I studied the concept of inflation .
>>es<< it would lead to tremendous air and noise pollution .
>>es<< I particularly practiced for hitting rather than receiving .
>>es<< people also do not do anything .
>>es<< so , to achieve that goal , different techniques are used .
>>es<< so they will be able to gain more knowledge during their free time .
>>es<< so lets not lose hope and let the scientists do their jobs , but I think being in a traffic jam is a stressful situation , it requires time and patience and there are so many more disadvantages of a large number of cars .
>>es<< when I was a senior high school student , I spent all of my time studying for tests .
>>es<< for example , there may be elderly travelers which may cause slow movement due to their inability to walk fast .
>>es<< this is evidence : the company that made some of the products had to pay a lot of money to the broadcasting bureaus .
>>es<< many people surrounding you admire your knowledge , and try to get familiar with you .
>>es<< first of all , it is one area that has been allowed to become more developed .
>>es<< in the 2 1st century , our young people can learn a lot of academic subjects .
>>es<< many climbers died because of the coldness and lack of oxygen .
>>es<< the new things bring brainstorming , which some people can not do .
>>es<< the government would like to reduce the population with this fishing limit .
>>es<< I would spend as much time as I wanted , if I liked visiting the place .
