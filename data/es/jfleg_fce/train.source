>>es<< and thie critica use few arguments .
>>es<< secondly , the information in videos is very delivered in format , it very familiar with students .
>>es<< the heart decease patients shows improvement when they are taking placebo .
>>es<< besides , young people uaually like new-fasion thing , like iPod or MP 3 , I can see that main part of young peole ca n &apos;t live happily without music in their ear and movies at home .

>>es<< the advertisemnet says that the car has space for 1 0 people when thhe truth is that the car is just 4 people space , another example is an advertisement of a skin soap , they said that this soap is the best because they say your skin wil be as soft as a fifteen years old princess , or that your skin will be as soft as the Jennife Lopez &apos;s skin .

>>es<< the way I see it is that , the only thing that guides do is limit you , and even more when your in a group .
>>es<< these ideas and concepts usually contain academic research which are totally reliable and dependent on the facts .
>>es<< from this professor agreed some ideas and dis agreed some ideas .
>>es<< but , I went to Juju island more than three times .
>>es<< I would have a variety of answers subjective to every person field of interest .
>>es<< the second one is to specialize in one specific subject , one has his own tast in studing , so let us talk about this subject
>>es<< I think that the car , twenty years from now will use electric fuel not gasoline .
>>es<< after this effort , many companies in the world startet actions to get this ecocertify .

>>es<< after the contruction in 1 9 0 8 of the first commercial car the ford T , man -kind has been subdued to the use of the car .
>>es<< everybody loves him and he does the same .
>>es<< successful people had gone through lots of hardship .
>>es<< younger people are still trying to obtain experince although , olde have it already .
>>es<< hence ideas and concepts are more reliable than the facts .
>>es<< take toys for example , advertisments that target children in particular are the best example of the way advertisements create a false image of the product .
>>es<< the cars were our answer to the needs to transportation sixty years ago , and they will continue to be twenty more years from now .

>>es<< while turned out reaults from both experiences are same , the method and the time that brings a result is not same .
>>es<< because you do not need to be a hero in order to try new things , you just need to want it and know that any result will be a succes in things that you want or in learning .
>>es<< in a such situaction there is no other way .
>>es<< in the reach family all the components have a cars .
>>es<< I held the map and tried to find all the famous points that had marked on it .
>>es<< even the magnitides on Mars are no evidence of life on Mars .
>>es<< for example , When I traveled France and Italy alone , I met a person in Nice who was a famous producer of the song in Taiwan .
>>es<< finding oil and petrol and digging for it is a very expensive procedure .
>>es<< I hope those things I learned will help me in the future .

>>es<< because you share only a single interest , thus making you a loner .
>>es<< in addition , students want to learn the language and they want to use it , so when they understand the concepts and the ideas it will help them to learn the language .

>>es<< we can see young people working over countries or working for others with tools like telephones or internet even if they look they spend their time just for themselves by being whole day in their room .
>>es<< also , most of people prefer to entertain athletics rather than other arts .
>>es<< there fore , he likes to do arisky and strainge things and he enjoy it .
>>es<< but after a few days , I found myself enjoying in it .
>>es<< however , what if they just work for the field which they already know how to do well , they might feel sad and tired .
>>es<< I belive to have broad knowledge to specialize in one specific subject have outweigh than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
>>es<< in my opinion if someone thinks one is more important than other why not to focuse on one ?
>>es<< and people feel more arkward when it comes to their ears that this is something going on as a current event .
>>es<< however , I woud prefer traveling by myself with the good prepation filled with joy .

>>es<< Carusage in the United States is very important in every day life , aswell as in many LatinAmerican countries , and thirdworld countries .
>>es<< however , companies tend to cut thier profits for workers .
>>es<< the one is the copper scroll .
>>es<< another sollution could be the developing of more fuel efficient cars , wich could also be good for America &apos;s car manifacturers who will produce more attractive cars to sell to other countries .
>>es<< consequently , I agree the statement with regard to three reasons : effecting of view , face to face with people and the first time .
>>es<< thereby the problem of running out of fuels is out of the question thereby augumenting my view that the number of cars will continue to rise and not decline .
>>es<< first effection is grobal warming .
>>es<< so , Ho Chi Minh city will develope
>>es<< Peolple like to drive different types of models and they want some thinmg extra in it .
>>es<< these useful skills that I learned from reality are going to be the greatest gift for my future career , and they can not be found in the text books anyways .
>>es<< that &apos;s why i will not hard as i am alon .
>>es<< this is important thing .
>>es<< books some times have an old information so it will be wrong .
>>es<< against those problems , people started to use cheaper transportation instead of car .
>>es<< however , I agree that having knowledge is being useful whenever we necessary information .
>>es<< but when teacher ask me did I understand it , I said yes .
>>es<< so i disagree with the statement and i think it is much better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
>>es<< raising tax for the gas can be the most effective and possible way to decrease the use of gas in three reasons .
>>es<< next , kids are more attractive to the advertisements .
>>es<< successful People are explain any oher mater and discuss any other problem .
>>es<< but it dengerous , because some driver make trobull with other driver and they when some driver crash their car then streets are busy .
>>es<< because it is allready a fixed data so nobody can creat problem with this type of litreture .
>>es<< also , the professor indicates prescribed fire should be carful when we use prescribed fire solution .
>>es<< if they cannot pay the high prices any more , people have to change into a bus or a train .
>>es<< this will reduce the pollutions caused y the carbones from the cars .
>>es<< moreover they have to learn aboue advance course material .
>>es<< the age , in my view , sometimes is a barrier to do somethings in life .
>>es<< in simple words they say they lost their appeal .
>>es<< for example , nursing students study in a nursing college for three-four years .
>>es<< I believe , that the product &apos;s quality mentioned in the shops are exactly the same as given in the adds .
>>es<< then , define your goals and work hard to achieve them .
>>es<< critics of this policy focus in three poins ; first , Yellowstone fires scorched a large area of land therefore a lot of plant species were lost .
>>es<< in my past experiences , there are some lecture which is completely baed on facts , and the chance for me to apply them is just rare .
>>es<< when you understad de idea is one way that you can figurout about the statement that you see in these moment .
>>es<< however , a lot of reasons explain about that the placebo effect does .
>>es<< in todays world there is a high and almost unreplenishable thirst for change .
>>es<< firstly , I think that communities equal human rerationship .
>>es<< it may spoil the health also .
>>es<< water is needed for alive .
>>es<< I the same other people see many tims on TV rich people are intrested in politica , sports new technologies and also in spaise .
>>es<< as a result , studies in Britain have shown that fluoride increases the activity can lead to more bone density and therefore less bone fractures among the elderly .
>>es<< also , sometimes , people may meet some new friends in the traveling group .
>>es<< if students just learn facts , they will forget them soon , but this will not happen so easily if they understand properly the concepts that are behind the facts .
>>es<< as on when i started completing my home work on time i gradually improved .
>>es<< becase if study in this way of cours , I will gante so much , I also will have alot of information the book I study .
>>es<< when you understand the concepts and ideas is up to you to prove them , to see if they are really what you have been told , i think this is the main reason why students prefere facts rather than just understanding ideas and concepts .
>>es<< for example , if you are attempting to study arts and scienses and to get equalifications in both , you are extraordinary creation .
>>es<< Gouverment will try to do something to not pollute the air .
>>es<< so in this field it is very importnat to understand all concepts and idease which they gave us and use to solve problems .
>>es<< because they sent out 2 0 % of the whole carbon emission .

>>es<< it is also take risks raher than only doing .
>>es<< there will be a technological development in the future , but that will only promote the use of public transportation system , but not car .
>>es<< not being with a guide gives you the liberty to visit the places you want to visit at your own pace and with the liberty to deliberate to any place you want to go .
>>es<< usually in the advertisements a presentable face is used they try to present some modals , nice babies , known faces as sports men , only to let the product looks better than it was .
>>es<< not that bungee jumping is something that every young person wants to do but even if he wanted to do it he probably would n &apos;t be able to .
>>es<< close-up video clips of a juicy hamburger flying around the screen , surely satisfying the models eating it could easily create in the viewers a false sense of being hungry and urge them to hop into their car and drive to a fast food restaurant nearby to get what they have seen .
>>es<< as we all known when we were out something we ca n &apos;t expect would happen , such as disease , accident or something else .
>>es<< and then , makers of cars need to develop the systems for safe almost completely .
>>es<< third , the proffeser agrees that the the gas prices in the United States are cheep , and they should Rais them to safe the enviroment and people &apos;s healths .
>>es<< now a days , there are many people who think they are the most important thing and they only have to work for themselves .
>>es<< in general , there are many peples in a book .
>>es<< but they do things in a different maner than others which gives them success .
>>es<< people feel more secure and comfortable to tarvel with their own car rather that changing several public transportation vehicles and reach their destination far later that they would desire .
>>es<< the second critic of this method is that the costumer lose all critical reflex and that he is not in guard .
>>es<< I think it &apos;s harder for successful preson to risk somethnig , thay coluld lost much more then others .
>>es<< we can have glance on , what is happening in the world through accessing internet in mobile also .
>>es<< so the importance of communities in sosiety decreased .
>>es<< but found that successful people use the people money and use there idea for a way to success .
>>es<< in my case , when I did a job interview , the employer ask me question about commensence like society , policy , art , and so on .
>>es<< at some time they have to face the failure &apos;s and lot of strugles .
>>es<< because it transmit the hebitats from Eastern Europe to different places in the world .
>>es<< considering a family going shopping in weekend .
>>es<< the another reason is many people see some of exutic cars as luxery encorragies the industries .
>>es<< in my opinion , I think advertisements are make products seem much better than they really are .
>>es<< so , some people use car only by move somewher .
>>es<< they have to think twice before performing even routine activities of life .
>>es<< most of the actors , soldiers , workers and students are young people .
>>es<< to respond adequately to the world we live in we need to understand it first .
>>es<< Infact even today most of these systems runs on electricity which can be harnessed by several non polluting ways .
>>es<< comparing with older people , they do n &apos;t even have enough time to enjoy their life .
>>es<< also its been on all the sections because we use the head phones it makes alot of noise and it seriously very hard to stay on task .
>>es<< they are clean and big and so on .
>>es<< and rolling stone gather no mass says proverb .
>>es<< it is difficult only to watch educations .
>>es<< and there is a lot of critics concerned that the reqired testing is so long that declined the valueable for patients .
>>es<< I have a reason that study English .
>>es<< for example , little children are told that do not cross the street at red light , because it is so dangerous that we cannot let kids learn from crash .
>>es<< in my opinion students need to a knowledge .
>>es<< so because more people are able to buy cars the demand for cars will increase and so the production of cars will also increase and in the end this means that the number of cars will increase from now to twenty years time .
>>es<< first , they have spend many time on the computer , so they does n &apos;t know how to communicate .
>>es<< we know that prescribed burning shud be repreated every few years but its very expensive to spent every few year .
>>es<< second differance between the encylopedia is that there a lot of viruses and hackers in internet and one of the hackers can easily change the Informations about any kind of topic .
>>es<< if i want to win a case in court in - for example , a case where technical questions are to be considered- it is not enough to just know about the law .
>>es<< second , if there is any problem with the goods .
>>es<< some people might say &quot; hey how does energy come &quot; .
>>es<< the successful people try to do new things likr any machine can help the people .
>>es<< however , the problem is how long will it take us to find out that we are actually controlled by the advertisements and the perfect image they gave us ?
>>es<< hence , German students will have to work harder , think much more and thus become even more skilled .
>>es<< one reason is that endangered animals is breaking nature .
>>es<< so i think having selfconfdence is more important than having knowledge .
>>es<< a younger person however will need to time to define his or her wants in life .
>>es<< the work should be good , and not just bundle of meaningless .
>>es<< always natural disaster bring economy damage .
>>es<< its rightly said , life is not about adding years to life but life to years .
>>es<< first , advertissment make me to buy some thing unplanly .
>>es<< there are two major reasons : it is profit to socialization and mental health .
>>es<< for the these reasons , I have to take high score on TOEFL .
>>es<< I believe , this number is increasing and will continue to increase as generations of educated people pass on their wisdom to their children .
>>es<< in my opinion , the need for community service and volunteerism arises in the absence of adequate resources or when somebody is not fulfilling their responsibilities .
>>es<< when i consumed that drink , then i came to know that we should not believe the advertisements .
>>es<< they just creat impression such well that people are drag to buy it .
>>es<< since I liked enough areas inside , I bought the car a few days later .
>>es<< exactly like master of none and Jack of all .

>>es<< so the governments and the scientists are also promoting the less use of private cars as they are one of the greatest attributers to the air pollution .
>>es<< people use the public water to drink water .
>>es<< because this is not very easy to use .
>>es<< but in my opinion , if you want be a succussful people , you should have brave to try new things and take risks .

>>es<< do we consider her as a smart girl ?
>>es<< for example in a chemistry class when you talk about oxygen is needed for a burning process you can give a fact to support your idea which is you can put out a fire with a blanket by cutting the oxygen .
>>es<< who we mach them togather .

>>es<< it will be always puls things for them .
>>es<< there is going to be a huge market if the product is totally brand new , which is equal to a large chance to make more and lot &apos;s of money .
>>es<< before wasent like that , we was all tha times under the voluntad of the man , and depending economyc from him .
>>es<< when you are a teenager , you start experiencing some sexual changes , which in contrast changes your way of thinking , thinking more about the other gender than thinking about toys , would enjoy going out with some friends , than staying home playing with your toys .
>>es<< by avoiding this it will lead to much purer and natural world for our future generations to live in .
>>es<< firstly , some immergent events happening in the other countries or areas may happen in the place you live someday in future .
>>es<< I feel that with the environmentally friendly benefits and with the attachment that society already has on cars will make people keep riding cars .
>>es<< I do not want to go Effel Tower in Paris or The Statue of Liberty in New York when I travel because they are too famous , so I alerady heard and saw about them .
>>es<< others would like to spend more time shopping than going around the places .
>>es<< I feel this will give jobs to people also because all car companies would have to adjust with this change , from gas into water fuel use .
>>es<< so it is complex , looking after many new employee every year can be difficult .
>>es<< in this case the advertisement totaly make a impact in that baby .
>>es<< maybe they had enjoyed life in young times too .

>>es<< nevertheless , this city is having a big change .
>>es<< I think to learn facts is only an evidence if the students can work hard and if they are able to keep every detailled information as tought , but it &apos;s definitly not an evidence for their intelligence .
>>es<< Unforturntly , almost older people can not use internet , in spite of benefit of internet .
>>es<< so , if i have alot of information about this subject , i will taulk too much with knowledge but if i have general information for this subject , i will talk about this subjec with my limited knowlege and this case may be make me shame like when my brother asked me about some thing but i have not alot of information about this thing .

>>es<< I have an IBM computer and my laptop is Dell .
>>es<< when price of gas goes up , the consumer do not want buy gas for fuels .

>>es<< when you`re making a tour guide trip , you already have a everything settled from the time you`re departing to the time you arrive .
>>es<< on the other hand , although in Turkey the public transportation is getting developed especially in the two big cities , that is , Ankara and Istanbul , it is still nothing compared to Sweden .
>>es<< as they are involved with study , they donot get enough time to look after their community .
>>es<< however , I strongly maintained that traveling by their own gives a lot of advantages .
>>es<< the even ask themself how this kind of things did n &apos;t cross their mind .
>>es<< people tends to choose other medias , and that is why litterature is in danger .
>>es<< I cast doubt that twenty years is too short time to prove the problem .
>>es<< so for these reasons i really believe that it &apos;s important to have a broad knowledge on different subjects , instead of being focused on just one , because sometime the answer that we are searching for , we can easily find it in a field that can seems not related to our purpose .
>>es<< I am pleased to know intelligent peple and learn about things which I do n &apos;t know .
>>es<< to resolve this problem , the governments of the cities are likely to improve the public transportation system by building new subway system and adding more lines for buses .

>>es<< as the professor claimed the details and examples to strengthen the position of reading passage , which I , in the following pargarghs , would like to provide the evidence to present the whole views .

>>es<< they follow the way the Sun goes from the east to the west .
>>es<< it &apos;s the time to take a rest looking back in your present .
>>es<< I thought it is kind of ridicurous , but we have to do as tour guide said .
>>es<< so , if Japan has such common sense since long time ago , even after twenty years for sure , people will aim to own a car and still ride a car to show people that they are ``rich &apos; &apos; .
>>es<< an example that would make this categorization problemmatic is an architect .
>>es<< and also the markting can do some adjust about the changing .

>>es<< and at the end , if you take a risk and you success in that , you surely will become a successful person with all the merits , and maybe also the awards , you merit .
>>es<< in my essy i want to focus on : how impotant is for students to learn facts .
>>es<< I naturally get to know that I do n &apos;t really want to know .
>>es<< however , what makes a student excellent is to both understand the concept and learn the facts .
>>es<< lrenikg the studens the ideas have many advantegis :

>>es<< the public transpotation in the city may not be able to cope with this huge amount of people flow .
>>es<< second , we learn many academic subjects , after that we learn specialize in one specific subject .
>>es<< this does n &apos;t mean that because you take risks you are going to succed .
>>es<< one of the most important problem is accidents for sure everyday millions of people dies jus because of the drivers not being carefull as a matter affect i do believe that there will be less cars in twenty years but this will happen just for one reasen that we will use somethink else .
>>es<< Internet offer a good opportunity for people that travel for work , for a student , for work .
>>es<< can you ever visualize what a chaos our society would suffer if every individual considers himself / herself an expert in every given field ?
>>es<< in this sense , I would introduce the concepts of two aspects with a datailed analysis , and then it will comes to the conclusion .
>>es<< in my case , my yonger brother need to more than academic knowledge .
>>es<< due to this , I feel that specialized students have more opportunity in future .

>>es<< obviously the unreplaciable examination and less enemy can bring huge advance to fulfill the defination about success .
>>es<< young people nowdays do n &apos;t give enough time to helping their communities .

>>es<< and one of them was my friend who had seriouse prblems with her health .

>>es<< he also tells fact concepts to the students .
>>es<< after majoring in any feild of studies a student can not adjust immidiatly with the practical world .
>>es<< by contrast , the lecture claims that quality of discussion is the most important instead of the numbers of discussion .
>>es<< concepts of a subject gives us the background of main streams of a subject we are going to learn and study .

>>es<< in my opinion there are some reasons why it is true .
>>es<< and availablity of jobs to the candidates having specfic knowledge is less when compare to the all round perormer ,
>>es<< Becuase when you understand the whole idea you can imagine how does the theory work .
>>es<< it is not worth to jump in pool without knowing how to swim since you may not be able to breath again .
>>es<< the person who takes many subjects stands az better chanceof getting a job .

>>es<< the first reason is that Groval warming did not connect with Anasazi disappearing .
>>es<< simply we need to eat and buy clothes , make and rise family .
>>es<< this happens more when one is watching a movies with the family .
>>es<< personally , I doubt that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today , based on my observations of falling vehicle prices , increasing population and stagnating rate of technological advance in the field of terrestrial transportation .
>>es<< I agree with that concept to take the risk and go for the new field .
>>es<< the size of the treasure written is too large .
>>es<< so it is very strange that why the poeple were able to live without enough water for 50 years , and then moved because they did n &apos;t have enough water .
>>es<< if they really interested in these courses , it &apos;s all right .
>>es<< therefore it is possible to believe that explosion of Tunguska was the explosion of asteroid .
>>es<< if someone is n &apos;t know eating is very important for growth bons and Brian or general for body it is fact but idease eating is just useful .
>>es<< advertising can be used badly not only by corporations but also by governments , as for exemple the nazi regime .
>>es<< he &apos;s the one who can give the different specialities the possibility to shine .
>>es<< such peole impressed other people through their strong well and divoution to duty .
>>es<< besides , smoke emitting from cars and the noise coming the car engines damage environment and the the health of people .
>>es<< the mainly reasons are such as following .
>>es<< it has come to be one of the effective measures manufatures use in selling their products .
>>es<< however , when I went to Canada by my self , I did many things that I wanted , so it was very exciting .
>>es<< it is not an easy task for old people to see young people sort of spending their time on useless things , in their opinion .
>>es<< for example , if you visit the ruins in Rome , without a tour guide you do n &apos;t realize the importance and the history behind these ruins .
>>es<< so that they have to pay more attention to their health rather than to enjoy arts .
>>es<< if your answer is yes , that is good .
>>es<< for example if the old person doesnot hear properly then young ones right from the day of their cihildhood think of inventing something that can help the older people hear more properly .
>>es<< right from the age of 5-6 years the children are busy with there curriculum .
>>es<< however , I firmly believe that traveling with guider is quiet beneficial because of it &apos;s posibillity to travel many places in a short time and safetiness .
>>es<< I have studed for just examination wayse studed .
>>es<< we will feel confusion and we Wo n &apos;t see matters clear .
>>es<< thus , I think when we understand ideas and concept will be leaving the main effects and influence because it combine with our opinions and beleives .
>>es<< is it merely understanding the idea behind that concept ?
>>es<< making exercitation students can learn how to proceed in a correct way and making wrong operation they will be able to understand the concepts and don-t make the same errors or mistakes in the future .
>>es<< adult content to sent their chirdren to school to contact these different kinds of class .
>>es<< what is the world and what are we supposed to do here ?
>>es<< this priedo not enough to evaluate the student .
>>es<< secondly , Earth ground had heat .
>>es<< therefore they could not get Informations about their needs rather than now , we can find out what we are want and get alot of Informations about our interests .
>>es<< Anglo version of Christianity became popular in the northern Europe and still now many people are believing in its doctrines .
>>es<< before selecting a product , everybody should read carefully all the information available about it .
>>es<< the disability of doing the things that desired make olders unhappy .
>>es<< the speaker argues that it is resulted from the difficulties of the today &apos;s literature .
>>es<< however , I want to go to the U.S.A that I can study and life in my dream &apos;s contury , I want to have my famliy that I never not alony .
>>es<< I do not know American teathers so but some Japanese theacher speak just facts in the class hours .
>>es<< because of this , I prefer studying concepts and ideas more thad learnig facts .
>>es<< a product needs to have advertisement so it gets to known around a place and it gets its population so everyone will like a piece of it .
>>es<< when someone have more than one academic subject it would be more amazing , interresting , positive , great , and helpfull .
>>es<< Therfor , I think it will be more cars than today .
>>es<< because we are watching movie earn something .
>>es<< but now every thing is change , the life becom more dificullty .
>>es<< they should understand what the ideas and concepts they study mean in the practice , how they can be used and have already been used .
>>es<< some products they sell it expensive because it was branded , some are cheaper because it was not branded product but if you &apos;ll see the quality , it &apos;s almost the same as the expensive one .
>>es<< it is therefore necessary to understand the idea behind it and come up with a well-organized concept .
>>es<< he knows how to draw a line of diffrence between gambling and taking risk .
>>es<< so , we must cooperate well with others , after we solve the today &apos;s problem .
>>es<< it may tell us how large the world it is .
>>es<< so a prohibition would n &apos;t solve the real problem .
>>es<< though the preferrences might be different for a young person and for an older person to fully enjoy their life .
>>es<< in younger generation one can find more joy externally by chasing their dreams and in elderly people the it can be internal .
>>es<< it has some problems that it can effect to humens .
>>es<< it mentions that now , it has reached to some oarts of North America .
>>es<< and I expect , if we lose quanlities of cars , we will protect our life , our environment , and we will not depend on resourse gas ,
>>es<< I claim that they are not yet able to feel the same feeling of satisfaction that an old man , seing his grandchilds playing , does have .
>>es<< hence , I did not have to wake up too early this morning , I took the underground , and the train , then the underground in Rome .
>>es<< Edison , who invented a bulb , is obvious example .
>>es<< many people think that treasure never existed , but in reality it exits .
>>es<< maybe I can not enjoy in real meaning and I am tired .
>>es<< this does not imply that either person is not enjoying life , or enjoying it to a different degree .
>>es<< even if they use buses , whtch are big cars , the fact pepole taking bus still reduce the number of the car .
>>es<< nowadays so many people study the way that makes advertisemets increase the sells , that is why our behaviour is influenced by what we listen or what we see on the television .
>>es<< however , I also feel good about this because this shows the huge leap we could make in twenty years , not just small steps .
>>es<< she also use this to challenge the reading passage .
>>es<< in this way a person always feels to be original and ``modern &apos; &apos; , not`` ancient &apos; &apos; like people that surroand him or her .
>>es<< I need to understand what are carbohydrates , proteins , vitamins and minerals and how they are unfolded in our body to produce ATP .
>>es<< and none of tourist will come and yellowstone will not be popular and of course , local businesses that depended on park visitors suffered as a result .
>>es<< when we go to their home , they look like to be hapiness .
>>es<< but if all you want is stay at home and live on your own , perhaps it is not that important for you .
>>es<< our country have been criticizing on the one way teaching .
>>es<< it is also possible that travelers could be re-schedule the plan and the destinations .
>>es<< as a conclution you are not atracted totaly by the product but , by the lifestile that this product will give to you .
>>es<< though I am from Fukuoka , now I live in Yokohama in order to go to Yokohama City University .
>>es<< in the twenty years , they also can give us the better cars to use less resources-consumed transportation tools and give us the much more convenience tools for our travelling .
>>es<< it is necessary a breakthrough event or product to succeed .
>>es<< lot &apos;s of people using bycicle to go where .
>>es<< second , old houses can stands in the way of the development of communicates .
>>es<< what we have to care about is that the oil is not used only for cars but also other materials .
>>es<< due to this new product is floop in a market .
>>es<< fresh water will be carried by the ship of that travels from Europe to the east coast of North America , and therefore the mussel will be spread to the whole of Europe .
>>es<< I do not gree that initative people will take risk more than those who do not .
>>es<< Graham bell worked a lot and took risks for inventing this telephone apart from is electrical knowledge .
>>es<< for example , during the traffic jam , the transit ca n &apos;t accomodate such large amount of people , how would the clerks .
>>es<< he or she can help me in languages , introducing specific beautiful places , what the special food in that country is , and how about that country &apos;s culture .
>>es<< and new gerrthion berfer to uesing the transport this why know thay think in tewenty years fewer car use .
>>es<< travelling by youself is very good for your fulture .
>>es<< in addition , it uses the North Satr to migrate directly to the north .
>>es<< sometimes , even a personality , like a famous actor , becomes this truthworthy voice .
>>es<< now a days all the up coming the gratdutes are just muging the subject mostly 70 % of subjectjust learl .
>>es<< for me there are few very friends or cklassmates that would the better for a friend .
>>es<< all the facts are mere deceptions .
>>es<< we still don`t know aliens to be or not to be in our solar system .
>>es<< if I travel in a group by a tour guide , I will be limit a time .
>>es<< attendence does not mean that teenegers are fully participating in class .
>>es<< trust me , the God will wish the young people .
>>es<< in studing the processes underlying biochemical pathways knowledge of biochemistry is required which is an integration of biology and chemistry .
>>es<< thanks to new and ``out of the box &apos; &apos; way of thinking it is what made our civilizations what it &apos;s now .
>>es<< when tlaked to the employment the company should not knowa
>>es<< in this moment become business became online-business .
>>es<< traveling is very importen to the peoples to know about world and in group TI could be might as well .
>>es<< it contributes to the air pollution and the temperature arising .
>>es<< for instance , the birds are not usually try to remeber the subjects what they have passed by , such as a stone , a building , or even a small house .
>>es<< That`s turth !
>>es<< IFOR example , you had to employ a supervisor the manage the factory , and the operatating bill is much higher than the transportation costs .
>>es<< because it had creative and innovation .
>>es<< so it means there is no certain way about how migratintg birds find their way to the home .
>>es<< their life is repeteation of studying and learning .
>>es<< however , the problem is if we use prescribed burning as a tool , it requires a lot of money - 10 times more than normal way .
>>es<< but there are several reasons that drawn me into this conclusion .
>>es<< they usually forget where the book set .
>>es<< who can say no to a buissnes that can make your life more safe ?
>>es<< for exammple , i prefar to specializes in public relation which is help me in my personal life , how to treat with author people .
>>es<< now let me tell you about daily activities of my father and compare it with mine .
>>es<< although the professor in the listening passage explains that the solution is acceptable because not only the striped bass population is vital for menhaden but also the entire ecological system based on it .
>>es<< the fact is that it would rain when the specific condition is prepared .
>>es<< that is not true also .
>>es<< first is how to release the drugs as fast as possible , in order to sell it faster and to make more money faster , but goverment requeres a certein amount of the testing to be done before the drug is reliased , so it reduses the date of drug release .
>>es<< may be one day there will be a tool that will take us anywhere we want only in a few seconds .
>>es<< so its depends on the defferent body nature .
>>es<< it &apos;s slow process but after the process they can use Yerkish signs and start to understand what people , trainers , researchers are saying .
>>es<< if we plant some speices which is very stonger to live , compareing other plants .
>>es<< because it rains more , and the plants grow well , so the Puebo can make full use of it .
>>es<< Additionaly , popular movies stars or famous people in the advertisements attract people .
>>es<< the first is our life condition .
>>es<< for example if successful people do n &apos;t try new things how people could do the airplane , cars , computers , etc .
>>es<< let us think of music as a metaphor for all the areas of knowledge , and the different instruments as metaphors for all the seperate disciplines .
>>es<< the more I study , the more I satisfy .
>>es<< billions of peple use it every day .
>>es<< major improvements should be done in public transportation to get peolpe give up their vehicles .
>>es<< many people have many reasons , like to see around abroad or to have diffrent experience , but their purpose have something in common .
>>es<< we alwayse joke around or doing something stupid .
>>es<< so , cars have a positive impact on the economy and I do n &apos;t think that the government will try to put restrictions on this .
>>es<< gone are those days when only rich could have afforded it .
>>es<< people like these often get bored listening to the tour guides lectures that sometimes resemble a monologue learned by heart for a class .
>>es<< so my opinion is If friend is stay in the world and then friend can help every thing .
>>es<< Lsat but no least , zenra mussels are likely to cause a decline in the overall fish population in habitats where they become dominant .
>>es<< scientists are worried that someday these fossil fuels can be finish and no more .
>>es<< so , it is important to student
>>es<< I had been struggling with the way of completing hard assignments , studying , improving a grade , and learning strategies .
>>es<< because in competition Man want everything better than his competitor .
>>es<< the undersatnd ideas and the concepts help students learn Informations about the many subjects and acccept good education form information the have .
>>es<< therefore , we think ourselvese that mind care of society is front do it .
>>es<< the basic requirements of today &apos;s man has changed .
>>es<< one can have alot of fun or enjoyment on the trip ; if you are guided by the person who known the area .
>>es<< but the only one reason is that they are never give up .
>>es<< any one has fears and feels scary to take a new challenge .
>>es<< the population explosion is another factor catalysing the consumption of energy resources .
>>es<< it can certainly help us to improve to other stage .
>>es<< but after a while the found out its not true .
>>es<< although , people have a great brain capacity to gain and learn knowlege , so it is easy to gain general knowledge about everything .
>>es<< but what about the stress that they have to undergo , the stress related not only for there position in life but fight that they undergo for their ambition .
>>es<< in the case of vehicles like motor cycles , the number of persons are limited to 2 and similarly there are limits to the number of persons that can be accomadated in the vehicle .
>>es<< as I see it , there will be a lot of research done in the future to find such alternitive energies , which will also be environmental-friendly , as well as cheaper .
>>es<< speed camera can be placed in many locations along a highway .
>>es<< therefore , I can more enjoy the trip without .
>>es<< he is a specialist in computer program but he do not know about other field .
>>es<< but the experience of painting gives me many new abilities in filmaking .
>>es<< bacause I have broad knowledge .
>>es<< people try to drinking it .
>>es<< if everone in the city uses their own cars , the city will be seriously polluted by the smoke .
>>es<< Dont afraid to do some new !
>>es<< it is rather than to give them strong medicins tnl them .
>>es<< Fourtunately their topic becomes more clear by using this much amount of the concepts provided by the books .
>>es<< they will have tremendous problem trying to keep their car at a safe place .
>>es<< secondly , they have the confidence that new way will be another way to improve a mechanis .
>>es<< they have limit to way which have meaning and function like a word .
>>es<< also save your time and make you satify this journal .
>>es<< to do so , companies must present their products in a better light than they really are as otherwise , the company &apos;s future including that one of the employees might be at risk .
>>es<< they are the boney and vital part o the society .
>>es<< youngsters , being healthy , have less things to worry about .
>>es<< she believes people can increase their cultural sense by good pieces of music or preciuos movies too .
>>es<< the most important thing , that you can do , is don = t tell him like a baby .
>>es<< to find new concepts and using it in their future job .
>>es<< I think that the biggest reason is devised environment compared with past .
>>es<< if older people are more acceptable to changes , their lives will becom better .
>>es<< there are very distent for ancestor to move the treasure form Egypt to Dead Sea .
>>es<< that means , just learn facts are not going to leave temporaty to students .
>>es<< although , I often hurt in this time which thinking some question .
>>es<< my personal perception is that such a behaviour is damaging to a young person &apos;s personality , since it promotes uniformity and conformity , rather than creativity and innovation .
>>es<< facts helps us to know the utility or advantages of the product that has newly formed .
>>es<< the other is about the extreme lengths to conserve water .
>>es<< it is important for everyone to have faith in themselves and always look forward and not stay in one place .
>>es<< every house nowdays has a computer , mobile , etc.this is the thing today &apos;s man want to live .
>>es<< these are enjoyable tasks to make your mind set be looking forward to the various experiences .
>>es<< second , if park has fires , animal that in the park do n &apos;t survival .
>>es<< I think the shrinking market conditions force car companies to fight harder to survive .
>>es<< then this phenomena reminds them , it comes the time of refering to other subjects .
>>es<< he could then strive to get practical experience of that field after all theory is lame without practical .
>>es<< while studying at university , people may still do not know which subject they should specialize on .
>>es<< these activities are only for future or amusement of them .
>>es<< that is the bravery and being interested to all things .
>>es<< I will describe those two main issues : to meet the modern socity &apos;s needs and to be eligiable candidates for some companies .
>>es<< when the Bill Gates was young man , he was attended to Harberd University and he was respected by others to just attend in the Harberd .
>>es<< because of fast-paced societies , we ca n &apos;t image what the world would be changed .
>>es<< otherwise , We are sick and tired of living in the world .
>>es<< take the example of Bangalore city in India .
>>es<< these surveys also demostrate how much young men and women are not aware of the improvements they could afford if they were able to really put themselves in an effective relation with their communities .
>>es<< and as a contradiction of this the professor said that dicease study is not designed very well .
>>es<< therefore , many psychological tricks are used to let a product seem more attractive than it is in reality .
>>es<< in order to maintain old buildings cost a lot of money .
>>es<< these factors can only contribute to growth in number of cars .
>>es<< sometimes , it is very comportable but , it &apos;s not important for me .
>>es<< Internet encyclopedias can contribute a new articles or make an editorial change .
>>es<< it so happens very often that many companies are involved in making the same product and this means competition .
>>es<< why there is n &apos;t one that was left around Tunguska ?
>>es<< have you ever think about this ?
>>es<< this is in contrast to the point in the reading that advertising does not produce any effect on American epople because they receive bombardment from different sources .
>>es<< if they teach them , they will never forget it and it is benefitial for our country .
>>es<< I can not imagine that during the next 20 years anything could hinder a American to use his car to drive down to the post office which is only 3 blocks away .
>>es<< for instance , when I was elementary school , I learned mathmatics formura without concept .
>>es<< when you look at the Honda Civic &apos;s advertising , it looks fancy as Mercedes , too .
>>es<< that would be frequently asked qeuestion , so to answer this question we should be aware of the facts .
>>es<< however far we try to cast a view , gas has become a very expensive item that will even become more expensive .
>>es<< clearly , you must show you skills and by speaking .
>>es<< it is very important for theme to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
>>es<< rather than keep his investment within the confines of the oil bussiness where he is the master he went ahead with his new plan .
>>es<< therefore , if someone comes up with that breakthrough or innovative ideas , he will be the first to capitalize it .
>>es<< students may doas not anderstand facts very will antell they ander stand the idea and concept that is related to the fact .
>>es<< however , almost all of tour guide would go there with my group members and me .
>>es<< the fact is that by making the nails ourselves they would probably cost us more than buying them .
>>es<< there are my children who are not going to school or colleges and coming to movies .
>>es<< but , in the technology and evolution time people &apos;s mind had arrived to a solution , they must decrease water carriers or water way ships which travel between North America and The Eastern Europe , or build more canals and ship ports so the load on the ship can be decreased and less zebra mussel is transported .
>>es<< it can be good opportunity to make their own time to do anything .
>>es<< however , she also said that some kinds of birds are shrink .
>>es<< yet I am sure there are a number of exapmles of people who have achieved success that would prove the statement wrong .
>>es<< however , I have different way of thinking toward the quote .
>>es<< first , young people have a lot of problems .
>>es<< this is an effective solution to stop an advancing fires .
>>es<< this always chalanges the consumers to buy a perticular commodity in order to satisfy their needs and want in the morden days .
>>es<< fro exemple , it will be easier for people to concentrate on a subject such as geology , having a broad knwoledge of many academics , than to try to concentrate on geology after having studied litterature .
>>es<< after a official training course , we helped the patients to bath , talked with the elder people who lived alone , and helped the organization to hold activities during special occasions like the mother &apos;s day .
>>es<< you can buy a vavilla cake in a fine store and another vanilla cake in the regular store .
>>es<< some guider is not sure about information .
>>es<< developing communities want to build more modern duildings .
>>es<< I strongly believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because of the damage decreasment , and technology replacment .
>>es<< most important , however , zebra mussels often have no predators in their new habitats , and species without natural predatpres are likely to dominate their habitats .
>>es<< it is possible that as the energy problem , the people &apos;s live styal will be changed .
>>es<< for example , When I was in school my geography book present ``Ploto &apos; &apos; as the last planet but the recent studies posted that`` Ploto &apos; &apos; is not a planet at all becouse of some different chracterictcs .
>>es<< but that does not mean that I do not respect and admire the others ..
>>es<< for example , in Korea , teachers teach something and students learn what teachers saying without dissussing with students while class .
>>es<< they do not need to know about what facts about that cake are .
>>es<< first , we can protect our enviroment by saving oil and gas
>>es<< to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , we can pick up more interesting fields about subject and it &apos;s too easy to understand .
>>es<< and I am completely disagree with what the auther want to say .
>>es<< I support my feel that it can be part of life .
>>es<< but on the other hand , we have a risk to poison this product , because farmers often feed their fish growth-inducing chemicals .
>>es<< think about it , If you are 50 ~ 60 years old you always think your health .
>>es<< I advice all people to always keep smaile and have fun in this wonderful life god gave us .
>>es<< Anther reason to joing a big company is job security .
>>es<< indeed , on the one hand , there are obvious signs that cars are doomed to be less and less baught by people .
>>es<< although we do n &apos;t have good grade , we have tallent to another things .
>>es<< the people attending this lecture will mostly be those that are specialists in the topic subject .
>>es<< to maintain the products more valuable they have sometimes use strategies to keep the clientele with same enthousiasm .
>>es<< also the second argument seems to be a bit out of context as the new technologies may hardly cut down on the numbers of cars used .
>>es<< as the profession said , pressure in water is another reason to have explosion .
>>es<< for example banks have many very specialized departements .
>>es<< everybody would in the end benefit from their experience : people in general and people who wants to learn from them .
>>es<< boys and girls easy beleive them .
>>es<< in this time , my opiniom is young people enjoy life than older people do .
>>es<< more Informations how can we get it is the important things .
>>es<< they dont have to read spacific books and articles just because they love the topic .
>>es<< it is not bed if you know it , it means that your intelligence is high but a doctor has to be absolutely good at safing and helping ill persons .
>>es<< if however the student will put only conepts and his / hers ore someone elses ideas or concepts , which can be mistakes will make the professor think if the student actualy did what was asked from the assigment .
>>es<< we can just hope that those cars will have a new motor generation wich pollute less .
>>es<< when I watching TV , radion ...
>>es<< after he graduated his universty , thanks to his skill of software , he can got a job easily and he become best in his field .
>>es<< it would increased in price after afew year and its &apos; owner would have an overprice and he would be a successful man .
>>es<< but the professor refutes the idea by illustrating some tested resulta from research condcted by a oil is not taken arouend the world .

>>es<< young people are more easily to adapt new technologies than old people .
>>es<< it would be similar to adding a few drops of water to the ocean .
>>es<< for usually success is connected with some achievement .
>>es<< if the explorers didnt take risk we wouldnt discover the new contenant .
>>es<< the second points is about the evidence , according the the passage the evidence that associates the sphinx with a know Old Kindgom King , and identifies the sphinx as honoring Khafre , but the lecture says that , these evidence are not strong to accept the point , it is not strong either to accept the Old Kingdom King , Khafre and his stone plaque between the sphinx front paws carries and identifies the khafre .
>>es<< first of all , you will know a lot of things about this subject becous you do not have any thing elss to do .

>>es<< bus , subway , even plane are means of travelling which can be used in a lot of areas .
>>es<< for example in a science subject it is necesserary that the students understand the way if not they ca n &apos;t follow the teacher .
>>es<< many people whaching advertise .
>>es<< but at that time , people who had knowledge on various fields , were able to find jobs in the surviving field .
>>es<< there is nothing has been declined of literature .
>>es<< they do not have to go to work everyday instead they may go see a football game in a different city .
>>es<< also , it is more comfotable to moving .
>>es<< Comming to atmospere and nature both are same .
>>es<< I wish I can go to travel somewhere that I can take pictures as much as I want it .
>>es<< for example if my friends talking about their proplem about computer issues , I will give them an advices about how to solve the prople or just to listen to and understand them will also help the to be comfortable in our meeting .
>>es<< there are a lot of car company and every year they made at least a 6 or 7 or 8 or more new car .

>>es<< I want broad knowedge of many academic .
>>es<< we had a lot of conversations concerning the future of this sector , but never detected signs or future plans for the sector which would implicit a declination of the amount of cars .
>>es<< because getting old is not just age .
>>es<< the important thing about this case is , each countrey hase to use official solution for their learning problems .
>>es<< for example a reasercher that wants to be successfull must take risk .
>>es<< the leg of all modern endotherms are undernearth it &apos;s body .
>>es<< so if they do n &apos;t update themselves with the recent study what they will gona tecah to their student .
