>>es<< nevertheless , this city is going through a big change .
>>es<< I think to learn facts is only evidence if the students can work hard and if they are able to keep every detailed information taught , but it &apos;s definitely not evidence of their intelligence .
>>es<< unfortunately , in spite of its benefits , many older people can not use the Internet .
>>es<< so , if I have a lot of information about this subject , I will talk a lot with knowledge but if I have general information for this subject , I will talk about this subject with my limited knowledge and this case may make me shameful like when my brother asked me about some thing but I did not have a lot of information about this thing .

>>es<< if they prefer to choose cars than motor bikes , that means there will be many cars .
>>es<< that &apos;s why he is a legend in these days and people respect him .

>>es<< as they are involved with study , they do not get enough time to look after their community .
>>es<< however , I strongly maintain that traveling by their own has a lot of advantages .
>>es<< they even ask themselves how these kinds of things did n &apos;t cross their minds .
>>es<< people tend to choose other medias , and that is why literature is in danger .
>>es<< I doubt that twenty years is too short of a time to prove the problem .
>>es<< so , for these reasons , I really believe that it &apos;s important to have broad knowledge on different subjects instead of being focused on just one , because sometimes we can easily find the answer that we are searching for in a field that can seem unrelated to our purpose .
>>es<< I am pleased to know intelligent people and learn about things which I do n &apos;t know .
>>es<< to solve this problem , city governments are likely to improve public transportation systems by building new subway systems and adding more bus lines .

>>es<< so the information technology and advanced technology have really increased .
>>es<< even more relevant to the seduction of advertisement is the fact that quite frequently those images of perfection placed in front of our eyes are just mirages and illusions , bodies touched up by computer programs and , therefore , they do not resemble reality at all .
>>es<< the professor claimed details and examples to strengthen the position of the reading passage ; in the following paragraphs , I would like to provide evidence to present the whole view .

>>es<< the timeline about this danger , which I have already given in the above discussion is so predictable that one can even have calculations about it if he / she has both the population and existing fuel count .
>>es<< I think people should travel by making decision by themselves with several reasons .
>>es<< indeed , they threat a lot of freshwater fish species because they need to eat and to find different kinds of food in the ocean .

>>es<< even if Japan has had common sense for a long time , even after twenty years people will still aim to own a car and ride in one to show people that they are ``rich . &apos; &apos;
>>es<< an example that would make this categorization problematic is an architect .

>>es<< also , no matter what , I think we will thank these animals for everything that they have done for us .
>>es<< when I grow up , I will start to understand what he said was quite right .

>>es<< and at the end , if you take a risk and you succeed in that , you surely will become a successful person with all the merits , and maybe also the awards you merit .
>>es<< in my essay , I want to focus on how important it is for students to learn facts .
>>es<< I naturally got to know that I do n &apos;t really want to know .
>>es<< however , what makes an excellent student is both understanding the concepts and learning the facts .
>>es<< ironically , the student &apos;s ideas have many advantages .

>>es<< the public transportation in the city may not be able to cope with the huge amount of people flow .
>>es<< second , we learn many academic subjects , and after that we specialize in one specific subject .

>>es<< Internet offers a good opportunity for people that travel for work , for a student , and for work .
>>es<< can you ever visualize what chaos our society would suffer if every individual considers himself / herself an expert in every given field ?
>>es<< in this sense , I would introduce the concepts of two aspects with a detailed analysis , and then come to a conclusion .
>>es<< in my case , my younger brother needs more than academic knowledge .
>>es<< due to this , I feel that specialized students have more opportunity in the future .
>>es<< moreover , before the oil and gas is gone , scientists will make a new car that can go by electricity or by sun light .
>>es<< I learned many kinds of subjects , also I could make different types of friends .

>>es<< first , young people have active minds .
>>es<< obviously the irreplaceable examination and less enemy can bring huge advances to fulfill the definition of success .

>>es<< however , the fact that most of the time they do not reflect the actual quality of a product decreases the reliability of the advertisements .
>>es<< we seem to have a lot of problems with those even though we have better materials than we did in the past .
>>es<< we can be fatalist and say that with the developing of the third world , the problem will worsen .
>>es<< these things can make us more successful in life ; even though we &apos;re that successful , we must continue our work , and we should take our chances to the greater heights .
>>es<< for the Greeks , philosophers Plato and Aristotle , the capacity for understanding ideas and concepts and the intelligence as the main ability of the human soul , are the parts of ourselves that make us the beings we actually are .

>>es<< to become deeper thinkers and improve their futures , teachers should be required to take courses every five years .
>>es<< in my case , I am working more than 200 hours a month in order to get money required to pay back a bank ( I borrowed some money to buy my house ) .
>>es<< students must do homework .
>>es<< it makes a good partner .
>>es<< as a result , she was able to get a job that she badly wanted but did n &apos;t expect because so many people were flocking to this company .

>>es<< he also teaches fact concepts to the students .
>>es<< after majoring in any field of study , a student can not adjust immediately to the practical world .
>>es<< by contrast , the lecture claims that quality of discussion is the most important instead of the amount of discussion .
>>es<< concepts of a subject give us the background of the main ideas we are going to learn and study .
>>es<< this example proves that knowing the fact is less important compared to knowing the concepts related to it .
>>es<< Einstein &apos;s seminal theory of relativity is proved by facts .
>>es<< while I was there , someone tried to steal my bag and passport .

>>es<< this will definitely cause some problems .
>>es<< nowadays , each of the family members owns a car .
>>es<< when you are able to understand ideas and concepts , and with this are able to understand structures of thinking , this can help you a lot .
>>es<< in America , a lot of families have more than one car and furthermore some of them have three or four .

>>es<< television makers just hang academic titles on their programs .
>>es<< even through everything , when there is life , there is hope .
>>es<< they have a special diet .
>>es<< this is clearly seen in the way many young people organize the collection of funds or books to help others receive a proper education , and , also , in the way many students go to schools for the blind to read books aloud to them and help them out .
>>es<< as a result , young people feel less sense of competition for a place in universities .
>>es<< however , Bill Gates improved people &apos;s lives and provided them the opportunity to live more comfortably than ever .
>>es<< also , students , by paying more attention to understanding ideas and concepts , you will not only comprehend the facts that are given , but also acquire the skill of understanding , which can be applied to all areas that surround them .

>>es<< it is better to have a very good understanding of many academic principles because it makes you broad , and gives you chances and opportunities to work in different fields and environments .
>>es<< for instance , Yang Zhenning , who is a famous scientist with great achievements and fame , has a high proficiency in literature while carrying out scientific research in physics .
>>es<< it is said that zebra mussels from the bottom of ships moved to fresh waters and devastated the natural habitat .
>>es<< this implies that there can be instances were no such overstating takes place at all .
>>es<< in my opinion , there are several reasons why it is true .

>>es<< it is not worth it to jump in a pool without knowing how to swim because you may not be able to breathe again .
>>es<< the person who takes many subjects stands a better chance of getting a job .
>>es<< so , to solve that kind of problem , they will have to use their understanding .
>>es<< another thing is that advertisements always show and indicate prices on commodities , allowing consumers to budget well in order to be able to buy them .
>>es<< however , the successful person , who achieves great accomplishments , does n &apos;t give up easily even in the face of things regarded impossible by most people .
>>es<< in other words , cars would not be of use in the future because of these types of transportation are being developed and invented .
>>es<< they come together for a &apos;LAN-party &apos; with the neighbor &apos;s kids .

>>es<< we simply need to eat , buy clothes , make and raise a family .
>>es<< this happens more when one is watching a movie with the family .

>>es<< I agree with the concept of taking risks and going for new fields .
>>es<< the size of the treasure is too large .
>>es<< so it is very strange that people were able to live without enough water for 50 years , and then moved because they did n &apos;t have enough water .
>>es<< if they are really interested in these courses , it &apos;s all right .
>>es<< therefore , it is possible to believe that the Tunguska explosion was caused by an asteroid .

>>es<< for example , if you visit the ruins in Rome without a tour guide , you do n &apos;t realize the importance and the history behind these ruins .
>>es<< so they have to pay more attention to their health instead of enjoying the arts .
>>es<< if your answer is yes , that is good .
>>es<< for example , if the old person does n &apos;t hear properly then young ones consider , from a very early age , inventing something to assist in hearing .
>>es<< right from the age of 5 to 6 years old , the children are busy with their curriculum .
>>es<< however , I firmly believe that traveling with a guide is quite beneficial because of it &apos;s possible to travel many places in a short time and the safety .
>>es<< I have studied for just examination .
>>es<< we will feel confused and we Wo n &apos;t see matters clearly .
>>es<< thus , I think when we understand ideas and concept will be leaving the main effects and influence because it combine with our opinions and beliefs .
>>es<< is it merely about understanding the idea behind that concept ?
>>es<< with effort , students can learn how to proceed correctly , and the experience of making errors will teach them to avoid the same mistakes in the future .
>>es<< adults are content to send their children to school to experience these different kinds of classes .
>>es<< what is this world and what are we supposed to do here ?
>>es<< this period is not enough to evaluate the student .
>>es<< secondly , Earth had heat .
>>es<< therefore , they could not get information about their needs , but now , we can find out what we want and get a lot of information about our interests .
>>es<< the Anglo version of Christianity became popular in northern Europe and many people still believe in its doctrines .
>>es<< before selecting a product , everyone should carefully read all available information about it .
>>es<< the inability to do desired things makes elders unhappy .
>>es<< the speaker argues that it is resulted from the difficulty of today &apos;s literature .
>>es<< however , I want to go to the U.S.A so that I can study and live in the country of my dreams ; I want to have a family so that I never have to be alone .
>>es<< I do not know any American teachers , but some Japanese teachers just speak about facts during class hours .
>>es<< because of this , I prefer studying concepts and ideas more than learning facts .
>>es<< a product needs to have advertisements so it becomes known around a place , getting its popularity so everyone will like it .
>>es<< when someone has more than one academic subject , it would be more amazing , interesting , positive , great , and helpful .
>>es<< therefore , I think it will be more cars than today .
>>es<< because we are watching movie earn something .
>>es<< now everything has changed , and life becomes more difficult .
>>es<< they should understand what the ideas and concepts they study mean in practice , how they can be used and how they have already been used .
>>es<< some products they sell are expensive because it was branded , some are cheaper because it was not a branded product but you &apos;ll see the quality , it &apos;s almost the same as the expensive one .
>>es<< it is necessary to understand the idea behind it and come up with a well-organized concept .
>>es<< he knows how to draw a line between gambling and taking risks .
>>es<< so , we must cooperate well with others after we solve today &apos;s problem .
>>es<< it may tell us how large the world is .
>>es<< a prohibition would n &apos;t solve the real problem .
>>es<< the preferences of a young person and an older person might differ for them to fully enjoy their lives .
>>es<< in younger generations one can find more joy externally by chasing their dreams and in elderly people it can be internal .
>>es<< it has some problems that can effect humans .
>>es<< it mentions how it has reached to some parts of North America .
>>es<< we will protect our lives , our environment , and not be so dependent on gas if we decrease the amount of cars .
>>es<< I claim that they are not yet able to feel the same sense of satisfaction that an old man has when he sees his grandchildren play .
>>es<< hence , I did not have to wake up too early this morning ; I took the underground and the train , then the underground in Rome .
>>es<< Edison , who invented a bulb , is an obvious example .
>>es<< many people think that the treasure never existed , but in reality it exists .
>>es<< maybe I can not enjoy the real meaning and I am tired .
>>es<< this does not suggest that both people are not enjoying life or enjoying it to different degrees .
>>es<< even if they use buses , which are big cars , the fact is that people taking the bus still reduces the number of cars .
>>es<< nowadays many people study the way how advertisements increase sales and why our behavior is influenced by what we listen to , or what we see , on television .
>>es<< however , I also feel good about this because it shows the huge leap we could make in twenty years , rather than just taking small steps .
>>es<< she also uses this to challenge the reading passage .
>>es<< in this way , a person always feels original and ``modern , &apos; &apos; not`` ancient &apos; &apos; like the people that surround him or her .
>>es<< I need to understand what carbohydrates , proteins , vitamins , and minerals are and how they are unfolded in our body to produce ATP .
>>es<< none of the tourists will come and Yellowstone will not be popular and , of course , local businesses that depend on park visitors will suffer as a result .
>>es<< when we go to their home , they look to be happy .
>>es<< but if all you want is to stay at home and live on your own , perhaps it is not that important for you .
>>es<< our countries have been criticizing only one way of teaching .
>>es<< it is also possible that travelers can change the plan and the destinations .
>>es<< as a conclusion you are not attracted totally by the product , but by the lifestyle that this product will give to you .
>>es<< though I am from Fukuoka , I now live in Yokohama in order to go to Yokohama City University .
>>es<< in twenty years , they also can give us better cars that use fewer resources , and give us much more convenient tools for traveling .
>>es<< it is necessary for a breakthrough event or product to succeed .
>>es<< lots of people use bicycles to go somewhere .
>>es<< second , old houses can stand in the way of the development of communities .
>>es<< what we have to care about is that the oil is not used only for cars , but also for other materials .
>>es<< due to this new product being a flop in a market .
>>es<< fresh water will be carried by the ship that travels from Europe to the east coast of North America , and therefore the mussels will spread to all of Europe .
>>es<< I do not agree that people with initiative will take risks more than those who do not .
>>es<< Graham bell worked a lot and took risks for inventing the telephone apart from his electrical knowledge .
>>es<< for example , during the traffic jam , if the transit ca n &apos;t accommodate such a large amount of people , how would the clerks ?
>>es<< he or she can help me in languages , introducing specific beautiful places , teaching what the special food in that country is , and about that country &apos;s culture .
>>es<< new Gerrthion prefers to use public transportation ; this is why now they think in twenty years there will be less car use .
>>es<< traveling by yourself is very good for your future .
>>es<< in addition , it uses the North Star to migrate directly to the north .
>>es<< sometimes , even a personality like a famous actor , becomes this trustworthy voice .
>>es<< nowadays all the upcoming graduates are just muddling the subject ; mostly 70 % of subjects just learn .
>>es<< for me there are few very friends or classmates that would be better as a friend .
>>es<< all the facts are mere deceptions .
>>es<< we still do n &apos;t know whether aliens are in our solar system .
>>es<< if I travel in a group with a tour guide , I will be limited at times .
>>es<< attendance does not mean that teenagers are fully participating in class .
>>es<< trust me , God will provide for young people .
>>es<< in studying the processes underlying biochemical pathways , a knowledge of biochemistry is required , which is an integration of biology and chemistry .
>>es<< thanks to new and ``out of the box &apos; &apos; ways of thinking ; these are what made our civilizations what they are now .
>>es<< when talking to the employed the company should not know .
>>es<< in this moment the business became online-business .
>>es<< traveling is very important for people to know about the world and in groups it could be as well .
>>es<< it contributes to air pollution and the temperature rising .
>>es<< for instance , the birds are not usually trying to remember the subjects that they have passed by , such as a stone , a building , or even a small house .
>>es<< that &apos;s the truth !
>>es<< for example , you had to employ a supervisor to manage the factory , and the operating bill is much higher than the transportation costs .
>>es<< because it had creativity and innovation .
>>es<< so it means that there is no certain way that migrating birds find their way home .
>>es<< their life is repetition of studying and learning .
>>es<< however , the problem is that if we use prescribed burning as a tool , it will require a lot of money - ten times more than the normal way .
>>es<< but there are several reasons that draw me to this conclusion .
>>es<< they usually forget where the books set .
>>es<< who can say no to a business that can make your life more safe ?
>>es<< for example , I prefer to specialize in public relations which helps me in my personal life , and how to treat other people .
>>es<< now let me tell you about the daily activities of my father and compare them with mine .
>>es<< although , the professor in the listening passage explains that the solution is acceptable because not only is the striped bass population vital for Menhaden , but also the entire ecological system based on it .
>>es<< the fact is that it would rain when the specific condition is prepared .
>>es<< that is not true , as well .
>>es<< first is how to release the drugs as quickly as possible in order to sell them faster and make money faster , but government requires a certain amount of testing to be done before the drug is released , so that pushes back the date of the drug release .
>>es<< maybe one day there will be a tool that will take us anywhere we want in only a few seconds .
>>es<< so it depends on the different bodies &apos; nature .
>>es<< it &apos;s a slow process , but after the process they can use Yerkish signs and start to understand what people , trainers , and researchers are saying .
>>es<< we should plant some species that are stronger and more likely to live than other plants .
>>es<< because it rains more , and the plants grow well , so the Pueblo can make full use of it .
>>es<< additionally , popular movies , stars , or famous people in advertisements attract people .
>>es<< the first is our life &apos;s conditions .
>>es<< for example , if people do n &apos;t try new things , how could people ever have invented the airplane , the car , computers , etc . ?
>>es<< let us think of music as a metaphor for all the areas of knowledge , and the different instruments as metaphors for all the separate disciplines .
>>es<< the more I study , the more I &apos;m satisfied .
>>es<< billions of people use it every day .
>>es<< major improvements should be done in public transportation to get people to give up their vehicles .
>>es<< many people have many reasons , like to see things abroad or to have different experiences , but their purposes have something in common .
>>es<< we always joke around or do something stupid .
>>es<< so cars have a positive impact on the economy and I do n &apos;t think that the government will try to put restrictions on that .
>>es<< gone are those days when only the rich could have afforded it .
>>es<< people like these often get bored listening to tour guides &apos; lectures that sometimes resemble a monologue learned by heart for a class .
>>es<< so , my opinion is that if the friend stays in the world , then the friend can help with everything .
>>es<< last but not least , zebra mussels are likely to cause a decline in the overall fish population in habitats where they become dominant .
>>es<< scientists are worried that someday we will deplete fossil fuels .
>>es<< so it is important to students .
>>es<< I had been struggling with completing hard assignments , studying , improving grades , and learning strategies .
>>es<< because in competition , man wants everything to be better than his competitor .
>>es<< they understand ideas and concepts help students learn information about the many subjects they teach and that students expect a good education from the information instructors impart .
>>es<< therefore , we think to ourselves that taking care of society is the most important thing to do .
>>es<< the basic requirements of today &apos;s man have changed .
>>es<< one can have a lot of fun or enjoyment on the trip if you are guided by a person who knows the area .
>>es<< but the only reason is that they are never giving up .
>>es<< anyone has fears and it feels scary to take on a new challenge .
>>es<< the population explosion is another factor catalyzing the consumption of energy resources .
>>es<< it can certainly help us to improve to another stage .
>>es<< after a while they found out its not true .
>>es<< people have great brain capacity to learn and gain knowledge , so it is easy to gain general knowledge about everything .
>>es<< what about the stress that they have to undergo , the stress related not only to their position in life but the fight that they undergo for their ambition ?
>>es<< in the case of vehicles like motorcycles , the number of people are limited to two , and similarly , there are limits to the number of people that can be accommodated in a vehicle .
>>es<< as I see it , there will be a lot of research done in the future to find alternative , environmental-friendly , energies as well as cheaper energies .
>>es<< speed cameras can be placed in many locations along a highway .
>>es<< therefore , I can enjoy the trip more without .
>>es<< he is a specialist in computer programming but he does not know about other fields .
>>es<< but the experience of painting provides me with new abilities for ilmmaking .
>>es<< because I have broad knowledge .
>>es<< people try drinking it .
>>es<< if everyone in the city uses their own cars , the city will be seriously polluted by the smoke .
>>es<< do n &apos;t be afraid to do something new !
>>es<< it is , rather than to give them strong medicines to them .
>>es<< fortunately their topic becomes more clear by using this many concepts provided by the books .
>>es<< they will have tremendous problems trying to keep their car in a safe place .
>>es<< secondly , they have the confidence that the new way will be another way to improve a mechanism .
>>es<< they have limits to ways that have meaning and function like words .
>>es<< also , it saves your time and makes you satisfy this journal .
>>es<< to do so , companies must present their products in a better light than they really are ; otherwise , the company &apos;s future , including that of its employees , might be at risk .
>>es<< they are the bony and vital part to society .
>>es<< youngsters , being healthy , have fewer things to worry about .
>>es<< she believes people can increase their cultural sense with good pieces of music or precious movies .
>>es<< the most important thing that you can do is not tell him like a baby .
>>es<< to find new concepts and use them in their future job .
>>es<< I think that the biggest reason is that the devised environment compared with the past .
>>es<< if older people are more accepting to changes , their lives will become better .
>>es<< it is very far for ancestors to move the treasure from Egypt to the Dead Sea .
>>es<< that means , just learn facts are not going to leave temporal to students .
>>es<< although , I often hurt during this time in which I &apos;m thinking about some question .
>>es<< my personal perception is that such behaviour is damaging to a young person &apos;s personality , since it promotes uniformity and conformity rather than creativity and innovation .
>>es<< facts help us to know the utility or advantage of the product that has newly formed .
>>es<< the other one is about the extreme lengths you can go to conserve water .
>>es<< it is important for everyone to have faith in themselves , and always look forward and not stay in one place .
>>es<< every house nowadays has a computer , mobile phone , etc . , and this is the thing today &apos;s man wants to live .
>>es<< these are enjoyable tasks that make your mindset look forward to the various experiences .
>>es<< second , if the park has fires , animals in the park do n &apos;t survive .
>>es<< I think the worsening market conditions force car companies to fight harder to survive .
>>es<< then this phenomena reminds them that it comes time to refer to other subjects .
>>es<< he could then strive to get practical experience in that field ; after all , theory is lame without practical application .
>>es<< while studying at university , people may still not know which subject they should specialize in .
>>es<< these activities are only for the future or amusement of them .
>>es<< that is the bravery and being interested in all things .
>>es<< I will describe these two main issues : to meet the modern society &apos;s needs and to be eligible candidates for some companies .
>>es<< when Bill Gates was a young man , he attended Harvard University and he was respected by others just for attending Harvard .
>>es<< because of fast paced societies , we ca n &apos;t imagine what the world would be like if it were different .
>>es<< otherwise , we are sick and tired of living in the world .
>>es<< take the example of Bangalore City in India .
>>es<< these surveys also demonstrate how much young men , and women , are not aware of the improvements they could afford if they were able to really put themselves in an effective position within their communities .
>>es<< as a contradiction of this the professor said that disease study is not designed very well .
>>es<< therefore , many psychological tricks are used to make a product seem more attractive than it is in reality .
>>es<< in order to maintain old buildings , it costs a lot of money .
>>es<< these factors can only contribute to the growth in the number of cars .
>>es<< sometimes , it is very comfortable , but it &apos;s not important for me .
>>es<< Internet encyclopedias can contribute to new articles or making an editorial change .
>>es<< it happens very often that many companies are involved in making the same product , and this means competition .
>>es<< why is n &apos;t there one left around Tunguska ?
>>es<< have you ever thought about this ?
>>es<< this is in contrast to the point in the reading that says advertising does not have any effect on American people because they are bombarded from different sources .
>>es<< if they teach them , they will never forget and it is beneficial for our country .
>>es<< I can not imagine that during the next 20 years anything could hinder an American from using his car to drive down to the post office only 3 blocks away .
>>es<< for instance , when I was in elementary school , I learned mathematics formulas without concepts .
>>es<< when you look at Honda Civic advertising , they look just as fancy as Mercedes advertisements .
>>es<< that would be a frequently asked question , so to answer this question we should be aware of the facts .
>>es<< however we view it , gas has become a very expensive item that will become even more expensive .
>>es<< clearly , you must show your skills by speaking .
>>es<< it is more important for them to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
>>es<< rather than keep his investment within the confines of the oil business where he is the master , he went ahead with his new plan .
>>es<< therefore , if someone comes up with that breakthrough or innovative idea , he will be the first to capitalize on it .
>>es<< students may not understand a fact very well until they understand the idea and concept related to the fact .
>>es<< however , almost all tour guides would go there with my group members and myself .
>>es<< the fact is that by making the nails ourselves , they would probably cost us more than buying them .
>>es<< those are my children who are not going to school or college and going to the movies .
>>es<< but , in the evolution of technology over time people had arrived at a solution : they must decrease water carriers or waterway ships which travel between North America and Eastern Europe , or build more canals and ship ports so the load on the ships can be decreased and fewer zebra mussels are transported .
>>es<< it can be a good opportunity to make their own time to do anything .
>>es<< however , she also said that some kinds of birds are shrunken .
>>es<< yet I am sure there are a number of examples of people who have achieved success that would prove the statement wrong .
>>es<< however , I have a different way of thinking about the quote .
>>es<< firstly , young people have a lot of problems .
>>es<< this is an effective solution to stop an advancing fire .
>>es<< this always challenges consumers to buy a peculiar commodity in order to satisfy their needs , and wants , in modern times .
>>es<< for example , it will be easier for people to concentrate on a subject such as geology , having a broad knowledge of many academics , than to try to concentrate on geology after having studied literature .
>>es<< after an official training course , we helped the patients bathe , talked with the elder people who lived alone , and helped the organization hold activities during special occasions like Mother &apos;s Day .
>>es<< you can buy a vanilla cake in a fine store and another vanilla cake at a regular store .
>>es<< some guide is not sure about the information .
>>es<< developing communities want to build more modern buildings .
>>es<< I strongly believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because of the damage decrements and technology replacement .
>>es<< most important , zebra mussels often have no predators in their new habitats , and species without natural predators are likely to dominate their habitats .
>>es<< it is possible that with the energy problem , people &apos;s life style will be changed .
>>es<< for example , when I was in school my geography book presents ``Pluto &apos; &apos; as the last planet but recent studies posted that`` Pluto &apos; &apos; is not a planet at all because of different characteristics .
>>es<< but that does not mean that I do not respect and admire the others .
>>es<< for example , in Korea , teachers teach something and students learn what teachers are saying without discussing with students while in class .
>>es<< they do not need to know about the facts for cake .
>>es<< first , we can protect our environment by saving oil and gas .
>>es<< to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we can pick up more interesting fields about subjects and it &apos;s too easy to understand .
>>es<< and I completely disagree with what the author wanted to say .
>>es<< I support my feelings that it can be part of life .
>>es<< but on the other hand , we have a risk to poison this product , because farmers often feed their fish growth-inducing chemicals .
>>es<< think about it , if you are 50 ~ 60 years old you always think about your health .
>>es<< I advise all people to always keep smiling and have fun in this wonderful life God gave us .
>>es<< Anther reason to join a big company is job security .
>>es<< indeed , on the one hand , there are obviously signs that cars are doomed to be less and less bought by people .
>>es<< although we do n &apos;t have good grades , we have talent in other things .
>>es<< the people attending this lecture will mostly be those that are specialists in the topic .
>>es<< to maintain the more valuable products , they have to sometimes use strategies to keep the clientele &apos;s enthusiasm high .
>>es<< also , the second argument seems to be a bit out of context as new technologies may hardly cut down on the number of cars used .
>>es<< as the professor said , pressure in water is another reason to have an explosion .
>>es<< for example banks have many very specialized departments .
>>es<< everybody would , in the end , benefit from their experience ; people in general and people who want to learn from them .
>>es<< boys and girls are easy to believe them .
>>es<< at this time , my opinion is that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
>>es<< more information on how we can get it is the important thing .
>>es<< they do n &apos;t have to read specific books and articles just because they love the topic .
>>es<< it is not bad if you know it , it means that your intelligence is high but a doctor has to be absolutely good at saying and helping ill people .
>>es<< if , however the students will only put concepts and his / hers or someone else &apos;s ideas or concepts , which can be mistakes will make the professor think if the student actually did what was asked from the assignment .
>>es<< we can just hope that those cars will have a new motor generation which will pollute less .
>>es<< when I watch TV , listen to the radio .
>>es<< after he graduated from his university , thanks to his software skills , he can get a job easily and become the best in his field .
>>es<< it would increase in price after a few years and its owner would have an overprice and he would be a successful man .
>>es<< but the professor refutes the idea by illustrating some tested results from research conducted by an oil that is not taken around the world .
>>es<< those who were open enough to try it , had the risk about spending too much money as they choose the first and only tariff , which was higher than other suppliers , but they were connected to the world .
>>es<< the old teaching system is a fair system because it treats teachers on education , teaching skills and the most important thing is the teaching experience .
>>es<< at the time of an emergency he / she could be of great help if he / she is aware of the child health problems and their cure .
>>es<< the problem is that when we and our competitors have more or less the same resources and the same strategy , both would survive but the chance of ones victory is not ensured .
>>es<< it is dangerous for the plants and crops and it makes the rivers too acidic for living fish and other animals in it .
>>es<< with this population outburst , more cars will have to be present to meet the needs of the people .
>>es<< it was said in the passage that the humans are endothermic and maintain an internal body temperature up to 37 degrees , the same with dinosaurs , that they maintain body temperatures up to 37 degrees or more than this temperature .
>>es<< if there were no concerned adults who had to care for feeding , care and well being of those children , humanity as we know it would not exist .
>>es<< as people say , ``The luck follows the ones that are brave &apos; &apos; and to destroy your everyday routine you must be brave enough and that will probably bring you success .
>>es<< in my opinion , I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
>>es<< there are two crucial facts : no particles from asteroid explosion , area of the asteroid and meteorite of explosion .
>>es<< young people are more easily able to adapt to new technologies than old people .
>>es<< it would be similar to add a few drops of water to the ocean .
>>es<< usually success is connected with some achievement .
>>es<< if the explorers did n &apos;t take risks , we would n &apos;t have discovered the new continent .
>>es<< the second point is about the evidence , according to the passage the evidence that associates the sphinx with a know Old Kingdom King , and identifies the sphinx as honoring Khafre , but the lecture says that , these evidence is not strong to accept the point , it is not strong either to accept the Old Kingdom King , Khafre and his stone plaque between the sphinx front paws carries and identifies the Khafre .
>>es<< first of all , you will know a lot of things about this subject because you do not have anything else to do .
>>es<< however , people who have not joined the event , seem like , are the winner because they forgot the event was early .
>>es<< second , critics argue that many cases of placebo induced improvement that took place only at a psychological level .
>>es<< second , he says the strong property rights developed from the factory system and not vice versa .
>>es<< bus , subway , even planes are means of travelling , which can be used in a lot of areas .
>>es<< for example , in a science subject it is necessary that the students understand the way , if not they ca n &apos;t follow the teacher .
>>es<< many people watch advertisements .
>>es<< but at that time , people who had knowledge in various fields , were able to find jobs in the surviving field .
>>es<< there is nothing that has been declined in literature .
>>es<< they do not have to go to work every day , instead they may go see a football game in a different city .
>>es<< also , it is more comfortable to move .
>>es<< coming to atmosphere and nature are both the same .
>>es<< I wish I can go travel somewhere where I can take pictures as much as I want .
>>es<< for example , if my friends are talking about their problems with their computer , I will give them advice about how to solve the problem or just listen to and understand them will also help them to be comfortable in our meeting .
>>es<< there are a lot of car companies and every year they make at least six , seven , eight or more new car .
>>es<< if any problem occurs in older age , it is a very difficult one for them .
>>es<< I think that talking with a person who has a different mother tongue compared to me is the best way to learn a new culture and language , however there is any chance to meet them .
>>es<< this fast pace economic growth , which can also be observed in a large number of developing nations , has brought about an increase in per capita income and improved lifestyles for individuals .
>>es<< in modern life it is all about the money and what you earn but that is not the only success .
>>es<< in cases like that , BMW is using advertisements as a way to show how really good the product is to the people .
>>es<< when Google was founded , other internet search machines already existed .
>>es<< I want broad knowledge of many academics .
>>es<< we had a lot of conversations concerning the future of this sector , but never detected signs or future plans for the sector , which would implicit a declination of the amount of cars .
>>es<< because getting old is not just about age .
>>es<< the important thing about this case is , each country has to use an official solution for their learning problems .
>>es<< for example , a researcher that wants to be successful must take risks .
>>es<< the leg of all modern endotherms are underneath its body .
>>es<< so if they do n &apos;t update themselves with the recent study , what will they teach their students ?
>>es<< second , the high cost of drug testing finally lead to the cost of the unit drug cost being higher than producing it .
>>es<< however , the lecturer says that the vague location was described because the ancient people wanted to keep the location of the treasure a secret .
>>es<< but , on the contrary , he argues that fluoride also has some disadvantages .
>>es<< he mentions that chemicals used for curing ill fish harvested in farms could danger wild species .
>>es<< for example , I like to go to a big city like New York .
>>es<< when we were born , our parents taught us how to speak , after we grow up , they send us to school to learn how to write , and sometimes you have to learn the vocabulary from writing , then you can use more words when you speak .
>>es<< did you give it to another person to solve ?
>>es<< everybody knows sports can improve our body , but we need try by ourselves then we will know , yes , sports really can help us get a healthy body .
>>es<< thus , we can easily remember this formula without spending extra energy and time and it is still useful to me .
>>es<< however , I think what students like is more important .
>>es<< they are simply manipulated by the idea of the top-product like best seller , brand , luxuries and briefly think about their own safety .
>>es<< first , he shows that in some cases a placebo made the patient believe he was gon na get cured , which made him create more killing cells , which cured him .
>>es<< and this probably might mean that our knowledge in limited .
>>es<< this rebuffs the reading passage &apos;s explanation that prescribed might be caused by fire spreading , so it is hard to coordinate .
>>es<< now they can afford the lawsuit case against music industries who sued them for about 100 million dollars for inventing p2p software to hack their intellectual property .
>>es<< thus , after you return to the city , you may become brothers .
>>es<< it &apos;s not incorrect to say that the world is losing some great support system to which young people can greatly contribute to .
>>es<< because we need food .
>>es<< when there is a need to do something , young people do not think .
>>es<< he will be mature enough to make wise decisions in expanding his business and trying out new things .
>>es<< this is probably because we are all , in general , pampered from the time we are born until well into our adolescence .
>>es<< the listening part gives us information , Vulcan , which was found on Mars and also found a bacteria but no one can indicate what kind of bacteria it is .
>>es<< in Korea , we are using the day-off system of using private vehicles .
>>es<< the person takes the bike , goes where he wishes and leaves the car at the closest bus station .
>>es<< I can image both statement of views , as far as I am concerned , I consider that cars will not increase more in the future .
>>es<< for example , the school will have a regulation that there will be punishment for those who are late entering the class .
>>es<< accordingly , most of the students have learned many subjects in their school .
>>es<< but there are still a lot of people who are not successful yet .
>>es<< second , he can not accept the results of a lie detectors and use it as evidence in court .
>>es<< they are moving by solar energy .
>>es<< it is true .
>>es<< I am going to another country .
>>es<< imagine , we could have trees in our garden that produce cherries and apples .
>>es<< I graduated from a university .
>>es<< a lesson is another new thing you gain from an experience .
>>es<< the youth today are aware of their responsibilities as a citizen .
>>es<< but I disagree with this opinion because often the advertisement does n &apos;t speak about only the functionality of the product , but it promises other characteristics that do n &apos;t depend on it .
>>es<< it gives him many opportunities in life and I think that being a knowledgeable person is a very wonderful thing to have so we can spend our lives in a successful way and full of happiness .
>>es<< in other words , the image in the TV commercial is the most important point that the watcher helps to determine whether he / she will buy it or not .
>>es<< Members gather money for the funeral to help them .
